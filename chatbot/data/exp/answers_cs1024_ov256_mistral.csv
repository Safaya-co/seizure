Real-time alarms, trig- gered by seizure detection devices, are needed for safety and prevention to decrease seizure-related mor- bidity and mortality, as well as objective quantiﬁcation of seizure frequency and severity. Our review strives to provide a state-of-the-art on automated seizure detection using non-invasive wearable devices in an ambulatory (home) environment and to highlight the prospects for future research. Methods: A joint working group of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) and the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (IFCN) recently published a clinical practice guideline on auto- mated seizure detection using wearable devices. We updated the systematic literature search for the per- iod since the last search by the joint working group. We selected studies qualifying minimally as phase-2 clinical validation trials, in accordance with standards for testing and validation of seizure detection devices. Results: High-level evidence (phases 3 and 4) is available only for the detection of tonic-clonic seizures and major motor seizures when using wearable devices based on accelerometry, surface electromyogra- phy (EMG), or a multimodal device combining accelerometry and heart rate. The reported sensitivity of these devices is 79.4–96%, with a false alarm rate of 0.20–1.92 per 24 hours (0–0.03 per night). A single phase-3 study validated the detection of absence seizures using a single-channel wearable EEG device. Two phase-4 studies showed overall user satisfaction with wearable seizure detection devices, which helped decrease injuries related to tonic-clonic seizures. Overall satisfaction, perceived sensitivity, and improvement in quality-of-life were signiﬁcantly higher for validated devices. Conclusions: Among the vast number of studies published on seizure detection devices, most are strongly affected by potential bias, providing a too-optimistic perspective. By applying the standards for clinical validation studies, potential bias can be reduced, and the quality of a continuously growing number of studies in this ﬁeld can be assessed and compared. The ILAE-IFCN clinical practice guideline on auto- mated seizure detection using wearable devices recommends using clinically validated wearable devices for automated detection of tonic-clonic seizures when signiﬁcant safety concerns exist. The studies pub- lished after the guideline was issued only provide incremental knowledge and would not change the cur- rent recommendations.  2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Introduction and purpose Mobile technology and smart wearable devices have changed the way we live and have become indispensable tools in many aspects of our daily activities, from navigation and communication to education and entertainment. This technical revolution has reached health applications and medicine, including neurology [1–3].

Real-time alarms, triggered by seizure detection devices, are needed for safety and prevention to decrease seizure-related mor- bidity and mortality. This is especially the case for tonic-clonic sei- zures (generalized tonic-clonic seizures and focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic seizures). More than half of the patients with tonic- clonic seizures experience yearly accidental injuries related to their seizures, and 25% of them experience a serious injury requir- ing hospitalization, surgical intervention, or resulting in incapaci- tation [12]. The odds ratio for injuries is 3.5 times higher in patients with ﬁve or more tonic-clonic seizures per year, compared with patients who only have one seizure per year [12]. Tonic-clonic seizures constitute the major risk factor for Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy Patients (SUDEP). All SUDEP cases documented with video-EEG occurred after a tonic-clonic seizure [13]. Experi- encing tonic-clonic seizures during the preceding year was associ- ated with a 27-fold increase in the risk of SUDEP, while no increased risk was found in patients with other seizure types [14]. Patients with at least one tonic-clonic seizure per year who do not share a bedroom have a 67-fold increased risk of SUDEP [14], the risk increasing with the frequency of tonic-clonic seizures [15]. Patients are often unable to recall their seizures, and the degree of recall can show strong intra-individual variance over time [16]. Both under- and over-reporting may occur, and the inaccurate doc- umentation of seizure frequency affects therapeutic decisions in daily clinical practice, questioning the reliability of large drug stud- ies, which are typically based on patient-reported seizure fre- quency [9]. Studies in the Epilepsy Monitoring Units (EMU), where the gold standard for seizure frequency was available from video-electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, showed that fewer than half of the patients provided complete seizure reports, and fewer than half of all objectively detected seizures were reported [9]. This was mainly the case for focal impaired awareness seizures (73% unreported) and tonic-clonic seizures (42% unreported) [17]. Impaired recall of seizures was mainly found for nocturnal seizures (86%) but occurred even in daytime seizures (32%) [17]. An objec- tive quantiﬁcation of seizure frequency and severity is needed for ﬁne-tuning medication tailored to the individual patient and for reliable evaluation of therapeutic interventions [9,11].",What is the current state of non-electroencephalogram-based seizure detection devices in epilepsy research and what future perspectives are there for their development?,en,"The current state of non-electroencephalogram (EEG)-based seizure detection devices in epilepsy research is the continued expansion and development of wearable devices for automated seizure detection. These devices primarily utilize non-invasive technology to trigger real-time alarms, which are essential for safety and prevention, aiming to decrease seizure-related morbidity and mortality, as well as provide objective quantification of seizure frequency and severity.

Future perspectives for their development include focusing on automated seizure detection using non-invasive wearable devices in an ambulatory (home) environment, with research highlighting prospects for improvement and innovation. This may involve refining existing technologies or developing new methods to improve the accuracy, reliability, and comfort of these devices. Additionally, there is a need for further validation of these tools in real-world settings and clinical trials, ensuring their efficacy and safety before widespread adoption.","The current state of non-EEG based seizure detection devices is expanding, utilizing wearable technology. Future prospects include refining real-time alarms for safety and objective quantification of seizures."
"The aim of our review is to provide a state-of-the-art on auto- mated seizure detection using non-invasive wearable devices in an ambulatory (home) environment and to highlight the prospects for future research. 2. Methods A joint working group of the International League Against Epi- lepsy (ILAE) and the International Federation of Clinical Neuro- physiology (IFCN) has recently published a clinical practice guideline on automated seizure detection using wearable devices [18,19]. The joint working group did a systematic review of the evi- dence, including papers published before October 16, 2019 (date of last search). Here we updated the systematic literature search in PubMed for the period since the last search by the joint working group, includ- ing articles published from October 2019 until August 2023, by using the same search string as used by the ILAE-IFCN working group: ((automated detection) OR (algorithm AND detection) OR (wearable AND detection)) AND (epilepsy OR seizure). Similarly, for the joint working group, we did a systematic review of the updated evidence and selected studies published in peer-reviewed journals, qualifying minimally as phase 2 clinical validation trials, in accordance with standards for testing and validation of seizure detection devices [20]. By adapting the key domains of the QUADAS-2 tool (quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies) [21] to the speciﬁc application of seizure detec- tion devices, standards for clinical validation studies have been proposed [20]. The key features are as follows: patient selection (subjects), recording devices, ﬂow of analysis and alarms, and ref- erence standard. For each of these features, study designs with decreasing levels of potential bias have been listed. Using these features, ﬁve phases (0–4) have been proposed, similar to drug tri- als, where phase-3 studies provide compelling evidence about the accuracy of the seizure detection device, and phase-4 studies are open-label, in-ﬁeld studies, in the home environment of the patients [20]. To qualify for phase 3, the clinical validation study must be prospective, multicenter, enrolling at least 20 patients with at least 30 seizures (assuming a detection sensitivity over 95%), using a pre-deﬁned algorithm and detection-threshold, con- tinuously running in real-time on the dedicated wearable device, and comparing the detections with the reference standard from video or video-EEG recordings [20]. The requirements for phase 2 studies are less strict, but the use of a dedicated seizure detection device is needed, and its safety has to be addressed. Retrospective analysis and using the same dataset for training and validation are still allowed at this phase. The number of patients with seizures needs to be ten or more, including at least 15 seizures in the anal- ysis. There is a strict need for a reference standard [20]. Phases 3 and 4 studies were previously categorized by the ILAE- IFCN guideline working group as ‘‘high level” evidence in GRADE terms, while phase 2 studies were categorized as ‘‘moderate evi- dence”. In this review paper, we followed the same principles. In this review paper, we summarize and cite all phases 3 and 4 stud- ies published since the clinical practice guideline. Phase-2 studies, per deﬁnition, would not change the recommendation in the guideline, and the detailed description of all phase-2 studies was beyond the limitations of this paper. However, we describe selected phase-2 studies, which, in our opinion, are likely to lead to further signiﬁcant development in the future. Phase-2 studies addressing modalities and detection strategies that were reported in phase-3 studies were not described in this paper to avoid redundancy. 3. Results The ILAE-IFCN joint working group´ s search in October 2019 gave 1,750 studies, of which only 28 were phases 2–4. High-level evidence (phases 3 and 4) was only available for the detection of tonic-clonic seizures using wearable devices based on accelerome- try, surface electromyography (EMG), or a multimodal device com- bining accelerometry and heart rate (Table-1). The sensitivity of these devices for detecting tonic-clonic seizures was between 90% and 96%, with a false alarm rate of 0.20–0.67 per 24 hours (0–0.03 per night). A phase-4 study showed that the use of a wear- able device in the home environment of the patients helped decrease injuries related to tonic-clonic seizures in 44% of the patients, alerting for seizures that otherwise would have remained unnoticed in 55% of the patients [22]. For other seizure types, only phase 2 studies were found: using noninvasive devices, sensitivity >90% was achieved using heart rate and heart rate variability [23,24]. The high sensitivity was at the cost of frequent false alarms (up to 500 false alarms per day). By updating the systematic literature search from October 2019 until August 2023, we further found two phase-4 studies assessing the performance of wearable seizure detection devices in a home setting [32,33]. Westrhenen et al., 2023 [32] demonstrated high sensitivity (100% median per participant) with a false alarm rate at 0.04 per h (median per patient) for nocturnal motor seizures P. Meritam Larsen and Sándor Beniczky Epilepsy & Behavior 148 (2023) 109486 2 in children, using a multimodal device including accelerometry and heart rate detection (NightWatch), reducing caregiver stress but not showing a signiﬁcant effect on the quality of life (QoL) or sleep of the caregivers. Hadady et al., 2022 [33] based their study on an online questionnaire including a high number of users who had real-world experience with using wearable seizure detection devices in their home environment. This study showed overall user satisfaction with their respective wearable device (different devices), as well as improved QoL. Most users experienced seizure detection sensitivity that was close to what previous validation studies had shown, as well as a relatively low false alarm rate (0–0.43 per day). Overall satisfaction, perceived sensitivity, and improvement in QoL were signiﬁcantly higher amongst partici- pants using validated devices (Empatica, Epi-Care, and Night- Watch). Most of the patients wearing a device had tonic-clonic seizures (87%). One-third of people with epilepsy experienced fewer seizure-related injuries, and two-thirds experienced improvements in the accuracy of seizure diaries as a result of using a detection device. Besides the aforementioned studies, we found two other studies [34,35] addressing device performance and/or user satisfaction in the home environment, though they did not fulﬁll the criteria for a phase 4 study.","What is the updated search string used in PubMed to identify articles published from October 2019 until August 2023 for studies on automated seizure detection using wearable devices, as applied by the ILAE-IFCN working group?",en,"The updated search string used in PubMed to identify articles published from October 2019 until August 2023 for studies on automated seizure detection using wearable devices, as applied by the ILAE-IFCN working group, is: ((automated detection) OR (algorithm AND detection) OR (wearable AND detection)) AND (epilepsy OR seizure).",The updated search string used in PubMed is: ((automated detection) OR (algorithm AND detection) OR (wearable AND detection)) AND (epilepsy OR seizure).
"Macea et al., 2023 [34] eval- uated focal seizure detection based on behind-the-ear EEG, with low sensitivity (23%) and high false alarm rates (7.8% per h), on a relatively small number of patients (n = 16), thus not qualifying as a phase 4 study. The in-hospital part of the study qualiﬁes as a phase 2 study (16 patients, 21 seizures), also presenting low sen- sitivity (52%), and high false alarm rates (7% per h). According to user evaluation, the likelihood of using the device in 6 months’ time was 62%, mostly due to side effects and low performance. Engelgeer et al., 2022 [35] presented an economic evaluation of a multimodal seizure detection device (NightWatch), showing that device usage saves costs and reduces stress, suggesting this device is a cost-effective addition to current standard care for children with refractory epilepsy living at home. This study had a primarily economic focus and did not assess device performance regarding seizure quantiﬁcation or other aspects of utility and usability, thus not qualifying as a phase 4 study. We found four phase-3 studies and 24 phase-2 studies, pub- lished after the previous systematic review by the ILAE-IFCN work- ing group. All phase-3 studies (Table 1) have comparable results. One phase-3 study included a large number of patients (n = 152; 85 pediatric, 67 adults) and detected tonic-clonic seizures using a multimodal device, combining accelerometry with electrodermal activity [28]. Lazeron et al., 2022 [30] used a multimodal device with heart rate detection and accelerometry to assess the detection of nocturnal major motor seizures in children with epilepsy and intellectual disability. The high false alarm rate seen in children in their study, as well as in a previous study [26], was largely due to the heart rate part of the algorithm. By optimizing the algo- rithm (the alarm was triggered only when the patient was in a hor- izontal position), they succeeded in reducing the false alarm rate by 60% (from 0.2 per h to 0.08 per h), but not at the expense of sen- sitivity, which remained roughly the same and comparable to that validated in the adult population [26]. Another phase 3 study [31] used audio–video analysis for automated real-time seizure detec- tion and showed high sensitivity (93.7%) for nocturnal major motor seizures, especially tonic-clonic seizures (100%), which makes it suitable for nocturnal surveillance, allowing rapid intervention. While the majority of phase-3 trials have investigated the detec- tion of major motor seizures, there was one prospective phase-3 study that assessed the detection of absence seizures with a wear- able, single-channel EEG headband, including automated behav- ioral testing [29]. Their results show an average sensitivity of 78.8% (median 92.9%), and although they saw a relatively high false alarm rate (0.53 per h), the majority of patients did not experience any false alarms at all. Even though most studies published on seizure detection devices do not fulﬁll the criteria for phase 3 or 4 studies, there are several that show promising results using various modalities: accelerometry combination with either photoplethysmography [36] or electrodermal activity [37], photoplethysmography alone [38], ECG [39–41], heart rate variability [42,43], behind-the-ears EEG alone [44,45] and in combined with ECG [46,47], and auto- mated video analysis [48,49]. Phase-2 studies addressed the quan- tiﬁcation of seizure burden using an automated approach based on EMG combined with accelerometry in patients with progressive myoclonic epilepsy [50] and a semiautomated method for quanti- fying the burden of absence seizures using behind-the-ears EEG [51]. An algorithm based on heart rate and oxygen saturation achieved good results (sensitivity of 87%) [52]. However, the input was based on conventional measurements and not a dedicated wearable device. A study by Frankel et al., 2021 [53] shows poten- tial for identifying focal-onset seizures, with experts blindly reviewing data collected from a miniature, wireless, wearable EEG sensor. Furthermore, a unique study by Chen et al., 2023 [54] showed a more favorable performance of a multimodal detec- tion platform in detecting neonatal seizures by combining data from the ECG, respiration, and accelerometer than compared to data from a single modality. Unfortunately, the number of neo- nates experiencing seizures was small (4 patients, 30 seizures), which might have resulted in a low sensitivity value (40%). Another noteworthy proof-of-concept study by Jeppesen et al., 2023 (phase 1 study) [55] presents an automated seizure detection method using a subcutaneously implantable cardiac monitor. They demon- strate a high sensitivity (92.6%) in detecting focal seizures with autonomic ictal changes. One recent pilot study [56] assessed out-of-hospital detection of focal impaired awareness seizures with a motor component using a multimodal approach (ECG, accelerometry, and behind-the-ear EEG). The study included 17 patients with focal impaired awareness motor seizures, with results showing sensitivity at 91% but a high false alarm rate of 18/24 h. Another study evaluated how different modalities corre- late with different types of seizures [57]. Cluster analysis showed trends of greatest elevation of heart rate (HR) and accelerometry (ACC) in bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (BTCs), compared to non- BTCs and isolated auras. HR and ACC were independent predictors for overall seizure types (BTCs and non-BTCs), whereas only HR was a predictor for isolated auras. Diagnostic performance, includ- ing sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the predictive model for overall sei- zures, was 77.78%, 60%, and 0.696 (95% conﬁdence interval = 0.6 28–0.764), respectively. A study by Halimeh et al., 2023 [58] showed that using prolonged postictal data (increased levels of electrodermal activity and heart rate long after seizure EEG onset) segments for seizure logging can contribute to algorithm explain- ability and point to inﬂuencing factors such as high antiseizure medication (ASM) dose and short seizure duration. 4. Discussion More than twelve thousand papers have been published on sei- zure detection. However, most of them are strongly affected by numerous sources of potential bias, providing a too-optimistic per- spective, which has caused much confusion in this ﬁeld. In part, this was due to a lack of standards for clinical validation studies of seizure detection devices.","What is the perceived utility of the behind-the-ear EEG device for focal seizure detection, based on user evaluation and economic analysis presented in the studies Macea et al., 2023 [34] and Engelgeer et al., 2022 [35]?",en,"The perceived utility of the behind-the-ear EEG device for focal seizure detection, based on user evaluation presented in Macea et al., 2023 [34], is relatively low due to side effects and low performance. However, an economic analysis presented in Engelgeer et al., 2022 [35] shows that the device usage saves costs and reduces stress, suggesting it could be a cost-effective addition to current standard care for children with refractory epilepsy living at home. Yet, this study did not assess the device's performance regarding seizure quantification or other aspects of utility and usability in detail, which may affect its perceived utility further.","The behind-the-ear EEG device for focal seizure detection has a perceived utility of 62%, according to user evaluation, due to side effects and low performance. Economic analysis suggests it could be cost-effective, but does not assess its performance or other aspects of utility and usability in detail."
"By applying the standards for clinical validation studies [20], potential bias can be reduced, and the qual- ity of the continuously growing number of studies in this ﬁeld can be assessed and compared. P. Meritam Larsen and Sándor Beniczky Epilepsy & Behavior 148 (2023) 109486 3 Whereas real-time alarms are needed for safety indications (im- mediate intervention to decrease morbidity and mortality associ- ated with seizures), ofﬂine (post hoc) analysis or a semi- automated approach can be used for seizure burden quantiﬁcation [28,51,59,60]. This means that the intent of use of the seizure detection device deﬁnes its mode of operation (real-time alarm vs. ofﬂine processing). Using the GRADE method [61,62], the ILAE-IFCN working group developed a clinical practice guideline on automated seizure detec- tion using wearable devices, which has been endorsed by both societies [18,19]. It recommends ‘‘using clinically validated wear- able devices for automated detection of tonic-clonic seizures when signiﬁcant safety concerns exist, especially in unsupervised patients who do not share a bedroom but where alarms can result in rapid intervention within 5 minutes”. The recommendation was conditional, restricted to a single indication (safety), and only for tonic-clonic seizures. The working group considered that the published evidence did not justify posi- tive recommendations for other indications (such as objective quantiﬁcation of the seizure burden) and other seizure types. The guideline is expected to be updated every two years. Since then, two phase-4 studies, four phase-3 studies, and 24 phase-2 studies have been published, but they only provide incremental knowl- edge and would not change the current recommendations. The only area where new applications seem to be justiﬁed is the quan- tiﬁcation of absence seizures using wearable single-channel EEG. However, only a single phase-3 study [29] supports this applica- tion, and the clinical utility of the information provided by the devices still needs to be conﬁrmed. There is a need for further research and development in this ﬁeld. Several new approaches have the potential to solve the cur- rent impediments, namely extending the applicability of wearable devices to detecting non-convulsive seizures [63] and providing objective seizure quantiﬁcation and characterization [11]. Although compelling evidence is not yet available for these approaches, they deserve more attention as they may provide breakthrough results. Wearable EEG devices record probably the best signal type in the detection of non-convulsive seizures, yet they must be con- cealed to avoid stigma. This is possible using portable EEG devices with non-invasive (behind-the-ear) [29,44,45,51] or minimally invasive (subcutaneous) electrodes [64–67]. Modalities based on ictal autonomic changes (heart rate variability, electrodermal activity) may detect non-convulsive seizures, alone or in combina- tion (multimodal devices) [24,43,55,68]. As patients may need dif- ferent devices depending on their seizure types and characteristics, and some of the algorithms may need to be ﬁne-tuned for individ- ual patients, recording the patient´s habitual seizures might be needed in the future to tailor seizure detection for the individual patient. Selecting and ﬁne-tuning the seizure detection device for the individual patient might be a new type of indication for doing video-EEG recording in the future. Objective seizure quantiﬁcation is challenging because it requires a high precision of seizure identiﬁcation. This has not yet been achieved with the currently available devices: although they have high sensitivity (for detecting tonic-clonic seizures), the relatively high number of false alarms precludes using them for seizure quantiﬁcation. Therefore, new strategies have been con- sidered. As opposed to seizure alarms, quantiﬁcation does not need real-time analysis. Off-line (post hoc) analysis allows the use of powerful cloud computing and artiﬁcial intelligence [59], and alternative detection-threshold values (different from alarm thresholds) [28], which can potentially increase precision. It also allows the use of a hybrid (semi-automated) approach, where experts review the epochs marked as potential seizures by the algorithm [51,60]. This way, experts ensure high accuracy, and algorithms minimize the workload. In conclusion, at present, the published literature supports the use of wearable devices for automated seizure detection in patients with tonic-clonic seizures for safety indications, as speciﬁed in the clinical practice guidelines issued by the ILAE and IFCN. Further research and development are needed for other seizure types and indications. Funding This study was supported by a grant from the Independent Research Fund Denmark (grant number 0134-00400B).

INTRODUCTION Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that affects an estimated 65 million people worldwide, characterised by recurring unprovoked seizures due to an abnormal, hypersynchronous discharge between communicating neurons [1]. Epidemiological studies suggest that approximately 30% of patients with epilepsy (PWE) are refractory to common therapeutic treatments, which increases the risk of a sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). SUDEP is the leading cause of premature death observed in patients diagnosed with refractory epilepsy and is defined as a death in epilepsy that is not attributable to trauma, drowning or status epilepticus [2]. Although the underlying etiology behind SUDEP remains un- known, studies show that in 67% of cases, there were indications of a generalised seizure preceding the terminal event [3] [4]. Additionally, there is evidence to indicate that seizure-induced perturbations in respiratory, cardiac, and electrocerebral functions, along with several potential predisposing risk factors, could contribute to SUDEP [5]. Lamberts et al found that 58% of SUDEP cases were associated with sleep, and that 86% of instances occurred when the PWE was alone and unsupervised [6].

These findings indicate that such factors significantly increase the likelihood of SUDEP, with studies concluding that up to 69% of cases could have been prevented if patients were not left unattended at night. Despite an increase in clinical studies, little progress has been made in characterising SUDEP risk factors and the underlying mechanisms leading to premature death in epilepsy [7] [8]. This has led numerous studies to postulate that seizure detection could serve as a means to deter terminal seizures pre-ictal, and reduce the incidence of SUDEP cases through early intervention and prevention. II. RELATED WORK The electroencephalogram (EEG) represents the diagnostic gold standard modality for capturing seizures within hospital settings, employing continuous electrical brain wave monitoring over an extended period. However, the EEG’s utility as an assistive diagnostic tool is unsuitable outside of a hospital or epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) due to the need for a PWE to remain in a stationary position with multiple scalp-based electrodes attached, and a full- time neurodiagnostic technician to interpret real-time neurological activity. To overcome the limitations associated with EEG, a new sub-field of research has emerged known as non-EEG detection. This approach utilises non-invasive methods to detect seizures in real-world environments. These methods include wearable devices that measure physiological signals such as heart rate, movement and electrodermal activity. The accelerometer (ACM) has emerged as the most promising non-EEG sensing modality, having been extensively explored in non-EEG research for capturing changes in motion and velocity displayed by PWE.","What is the purpose and unique contribution of the Open Seizure Database and Toolkit introduced in this research, and what kind of data does it contain from its participants in real-world, in-home environments?",en,"The purpose of the Open Seizure Database and Toolkit, as introduced in this research, is to advance non-electroencephalogram seizure detection research. It achieves this by being a publicly accessible resource that provides multimodal sensor data from 49 participants in real-world, in-home environments. The unique contribution of this database is that it addresses the scarcity of resources in the non-electroencephalogram domain and establishes itself as the first openly accessible database containing such data. The database contains 494 events over a duration of 453 days, which includes 146 epileptic seizures and 348 labelled false alarms that represent common human movements and activities.","The Open Seizure Database & Toolkit aim to advance non-EEG seizure detection research.

"Notably, these investigations have showcased the ACMs potential for detecting rhythmic movements, particularly those associated with a generalised tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures. By leveraging ACM data, sophisticated algorithms have been developed to identify the convulsive movements characteristic of a seizure’s clonic phase. Seminal studies conducted by Conradsen et al. and Lockman et al, serve as notable examples, demonstrating the practical application of ACM-based detection with remarkable accuracies of 90% and 91% respectively [9] [10]. However, it is important to note that the ACM data utilised in these studies did not originate from patients diagnosed with epilepsy; rather, it was simulated by healthy participants in controlled short- term studies. This prevailing trend is widespread in the field of non- EEG seizure detection, as a significant portion of studies have relied on small-scale, simulated, or synthetic datasets [16]. Two predominate factors contribute to this observation. Firstly, the field of research in non-EEG detection is relatively new, and as such, there are no established, publicly available datasets, which are more common in other domains of healthcare research. Secondly, epileptic seizures are infrequent, rare events, which makes it challenging to record an extensive dataset of generalised seizure recordings from multiple PWE. 2 GENERIC COLORIZED JOURNAL, VOL.

However, upon closer examination, it becomes evident that a significant portion of the data is either simulated or recorded using sub-optimal sensing modalities, such as smartphones with embedded ACMs. Additionally, the existing data lacks the necessary depth to capture the complexities inherent in different types of epilepsy. To address this, non-EEG data should be recorded from real-world, in-home environments, as this is where most seizures and SUDEP cases occur. By utilising real-world data, non-EEG detection systems can be modelled to accurately reflect the real-world complexities encountered by PWE in their day to day lives. While publicly available non-EEG data remains limited, com- mercial organisations and international consortiums have conducted studies using several non-EEG detection techniques. Empatica’s Embrace has been used in several studies to detect convulsive seizures, demonstrating an average sensitivity of 92-100% and a false alarm rate (FAR) between 0.2-1 per day [17] [18] [19] [20]. Another commercially available device, Seer Medical’s smartwatch has yielded a mean area under curve (AUC), a sensitivity, and a FAR per day of 0.98, 0.93, and 2.3, respectively for 19 motor seizures from 10 in-hospital patients [21]. However, it should be noted that the data used in these studies is not accessible to the wider academic community, limiting the ability to replicate these findings. Additionally, consideration should be given to the fact that the data used in these commercial studies predominantly originates from clinical trials conducted in EMUs, where the environmental dynamics are closely regulated [22] . The progress in non-EEG research is currently hindered by the lack of publicly available data, impeding scientific advancements and leading to slower progress compared to other fields utilising Machine Learning/Deep Learning techniques in clinical practice [23]. Additionally, non-EEG literature often demonstrates high accuracy scores but is accompanied by a significant occurrence of false positives. The presence of false alarms poses challenges in real- world seizure detection applications, as it can result in unnecessary alerts, incorrectly indicating the presence of a seizure [24]. Reducing false alarms is crucial to enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of seizure detection models. The use of multimodal sensors shows promise in achieving this goal. By combining data from different sensors, a more accurate and robust dataset can be constructed for the development of intelligent detection models. Several studies have suggested that multimodal sensing could decrease the false positive rate observed in literature and improve the accuracy and performance of existing seizure detection models. To achieve these goals there is a pressing need for a large-scale in-home study to record multimodal sensor data. By recording individuals with epilepsy in their real-world home environments using multiple sensors, a comprehensive dataset could be created, offering sufficient depth and breadth to tackle the current challenges in non-EEG seizure detection research. Large-scale data repositories and collaborative data sharing have become integral to clinical progress. In epilepsy research, the Euro- pean Epilepsy Database (EED) is the largest and most comprehensive database for human surface and intracranial EEG recordings. It contains clinically annotated pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal EEG data from 278 patients suffering from pharmaco-resistant partial epilepsy [25] [26]. Through collaborative sharing and centralised data access, the EED has been cited in over 138 publications, facilitating research progress in the field of EEG detection [25]. However, the EED stores data strictly for neurological research and does not store any non-EEG resources. A publicly available non-EEG database dedicated to storing sensor data from patients with epilepsy in real-world conditions holds great potential for transforming the field of seizure detection research. This approach would enable benchmark testing and comparative analysis under reproducible conditions, facilitating the evaluation and advancement of novel seizure detection techniques. Moreover, such a database could advance epilepsy research through data sharing and collaboration [27], enabling researchers to investigate innovative concepts such as patient-specific and seizure-specific detection. This paper is organised into the following sections: Section III details the development of the Open Seizure Database. Section IV outlines the Open Seizure Toolkit, highlighting its capacity to rapidly develop algorithms compatible with Open Seizure Detector.","What are the two predominant factors contributing to the observation that a significant portion of studies in non-EEG seizure detection rely on small-scale, simulated, or synthetic datasets?",en,"Les deux principaux facteurs qui contribuent à l'observation que une grande partie des études dans la détection de non-EEG repose sur des échelles petites, simulées ou synthétiques sont les suivants :

METHODOLOGY This study introduces the Open Seizure Database (OSDB) and Open Seizure Toolkit (OSTK) as novel contributions to the field of non-EEG seizure detection [28]. Developed in collaboration between Open Seizure Detector (OSD) [29] and the University of West Lon- don [30], the OSDB serves as the first publicly accessible database containing non-EEG epileptic seizure recordings from real-world, in- home environments. OSD, established in 2013, is the largest open- source seizure detection software package, distributed under the open- source, GNU General Public License (GPL), boasting over 5000 downloads [31], and an estimated 300 daily users [29]. A comprehensive beta trial was conducted, utilising non-invasive wearable sensing devices to capture non-EEG data from a diverse cohort of participants diagnosed with various forms of epilepsy. This beta trial, closely supervised by OSD, spanned from January to June 2022. In adherence to ethical standards, all participants provided informed consent [33], and voluntarily enrolled in the beta trial through the Google Play Services Public Beta Program [32]. Furthermore, this research study obtained approval from the ethics committee at the University of West London. J PORDOY et al. : PREPARATION OF BRIEF PAPERS FOR IEEE TRANSACTIONS AND JOURNALS (FEBRUARY 2017) 3 Fig. 1: An illustration of the Open Seizure Detector architecture used to record participant data. The architecture consists of four main components, Open Seizure Detector Android Application, Open Seizure Web Server, Open Seizure Database and the Open Seizure Toolkit To uphold strict confidentiality during the data collection process, stringent measures were implemented, encompassing the removal of personal identifiers to ensure anonymity. Subsequent to the beta trial period, the opportunity to contribute data to the database was extended to all OSD users who consented to the data safety statement. Notably, data collection remains ongoing to the present day. For the beta trial, individuals with partial-onset epilepsy, partic- ularly those susceptible to absence or complex focal seizures, were intentionally excluded during the initial phase of data collection. This decision was predicated on the absence of tonic, atonic, myoclonic, or clonic movements typically associated with generalised epilepsy. Consequently, among the participants who signed up to the beta trial, 49 individuals met the required criteria concerning both technological aspects, such as device and sensor compatibility, as well as physio- logical requirements pertaining to the type of epilepsy. Participants were instructed to install the OSD Android application [31] and continually wear a wrist-worn sensor device (Fig. 3), except when charging was required. Several Garmin devices (TABLE III) were employed for data collection, in which sensor data was transmit- ted to the participants Android device using a Bluetooth connection. Sensor data is then stored temporally on the end users device where it is analysed to detect seizure-like movement as described in Section III-F. When seizure-like movement is detected, the associated data is stored long term using the OSD web server (Fig. 1). A. Dataset During the 453 day data collection period, a total of 494 events were recorded from 49 participants. 146 events were recorded as epileptic seizures, while the remaining 348 were classified as false alarms. Among the false alarms, 302 were associated with human/- physical activities and were appropriately labelled as such (Fig. 2). The remaining 46 events were categorised as false alarms where the activity is unknown. Epileptic seizures were recorded from 18 participants, amounting to a cumulative duration of 5 hours and 51 minutes (TABLE II). A diverse range of epileptic seizures were recorded with 50 GTC seizures, 27 aura/focal seizures, 22 atonic seizures/falls and 47 seizures labelled as ”Other Seizure”. It is important to note that, for the purposes of this study, ”Other seizure” are defined as seizures that were labelled only by type (e.g. seizure or false alarm). Participants did not provide further categorisation of the events specific sub-types (e.g. atonic, aura, tonic-clonic). Fig. 2: Summary of the different events recorded. Epileptic-related events are highlighted in orange, while common human activities responsible for triggering false alarms are indicated in blue. B. Sensing Modalities Recording epileptic seizures from a large group of participants using multiple sensors is a significant challenge. To overcome this, we employed Garmin wearable devices, capable of measuring accelerom- etry, photoplethysmography (PPG), and pulse-oximetry (Sp02) sig- nals. The use of Garmin devices proved to be a cost-effective and easily accessible solution to record sensor data (Fig. 4) from a large cohort of participants with epilepsy in their real-world, home environments. This section details the sensors used during the study. Garmin wrist-worn devices are equipped with tri-axis ACM and have a sensing range of ±2 g up to ±16 g, where ’g’ quantifies the gravitational forces along different device axes [34]. This range signifies the maximum acceleration value accurately measurable by a Garmin device. The ±2 g range accommodates the broad spectrum of human movements and activities, while the ±16 g range can facilitate the detection of high intensity movements. For heart rate monitoring, Garmin devices are equipped with an embedded optical PPG sensor, located on the back, which utilises a green light-emitting diode to emit light onto the skin, thereby mea- suring volumetric variations in blood circulation [35]. The reflected light from the red blood cells in the skin facilitates the measurement of the participant’s heart rate in beats per minute (bpm). 4 GENERIC COLORIZED JOURNAL, VOL. XX, NO.

These devices utilise two wavelengths of light, red and infrared, with red light being absorbed by oxygenated blood and infrared light by deoxygenated blood. By analysing the absorption ratio of these wavelengths, oxygen saturation levels can be calculated [36]. C. Data Storage To address the long-term data storage requirements, a mobile- client, client-server architecture was implemented. Short-term data J PORDOY et al. : PREPARATION OF BRIEF PAPERS FOR IEEE TRANSACTIONS AND JOURNALS (FEBRUARY 2017) 5 storage utilised an SQLite database on each participants Android device, leveraging local storage capabilities. Mobile Sync ensured efficient and reliable data synchronisation between the mobile client and the OSD web server. Sensor data was transmitted using Bluetooth in 5 second timesteps (intervals) to the on-device database, striking a balance between capturing sufficient information for seizure detection and minimis- ing energy consumption. Furthermore, the periodic transmission of locally stored data to the OSD Web Server was designed to prevent potential bottlenecks during the upload. The OSDB was designed to be flexible and maintain backward compatibility. Initially, it stored one-dimensional ACM data in the form of vector magnitude and heart rate data. However, during the beta trial, adjustments were made to accommodate the storage of SpO2 and three-dimensional ACM data. By utilising an SQLite database on the Android platform and integrating additional fea- tures and sensors, the OSD project achieved scalability and ensured compatibility. Design choices were driven by the goal of optimising data storage, capturing relevant sensor data, and improving overall performance. D. Database Schema The database schema for the OSDB was carefully anonymized and preprocessed, and the data was converted into a series of JSON scripts. The utilisation of JSON provided a structured representation of the data, ensuring accessibility across different platforms and programming languages. Version 1 of the OSDB is available upon request through the OSDB GitHub repository. It can be accessed either as a single JSON script containing data for all labelled events or as a subset focusing on specific event types such as tonic-clonic or false alarms. The datasets are organised hierarchically using a one-to-many relationship, where each event has multiple sub-events. Each sub-event corresponds to a 5-second timestep, and sensor data for that timestep is stored as a JSON array called ”Datapoints.” The complete JSON schema of the OSDB, including accurate attribute names, arrays, and data types, is provided in Fig. 5 and TABLE IV. E. Annotating Event Labels As the beta trial had a diverse cohort of participants spread across the globe, a self-annotation system was developed where participants were able to label an event as it occurred using the OSD Android application. When an event was detected, participants were instructed to label the event by type (e.g., Seizure, false alarm) and then sub-type (e.g., aura, tonic-clonic). Participants had the flexibility to add custom class labels for more accurate annotation or choose from a predefined set of labels commonly associated with false alarms. Additionally, participants had the option to manually trigger an alarm and label an event in cases where the algorithm failed to detect a seizure.

XX, NO. XX, XXXX 2017 F. Open Seizure Detector Algorithm For seizure detection during the beta trial, participants were in- structed to use the OSD Android application which runs a deter- ministic detection algorithm. Sensor data was transmitted from the participants’ Garmin device to the OSD application in five second timesteps at a sample frequency of 25 Hz, resulting in 125 measure- ments per timestep. To optimise the battery capacity of participants Android devices, acceleration was in measured as a unit of vector magnitude instead of measuring three separate spatial dimensions (x, y, z), thus reducing the computational requirements by a factor of 2 3. This decision was made to increase the data collection duration without the need for frequent battery replacement or recharging. Vector magnitude for the current timestep can be calculated as At = q (a2 x−t + a2 y−t + a2 z−t) (1) Where ax−t, ax−t and ax−t represent the moving acceleration of each orthogonal axis for timestep (t). The algorithm then transforms the vector magnitude signal from the time domain to the frequency domain by utilising a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to compute the power in each frequency range. As stated by the Nyquist Theorem, the maximum frequency that can faithfully represent the original signal is half of the sample frequency [37]. Consequently, the OSD algorithm running on a Garmin device is capable of precisely reconstructing signals with frequencies up to 12.5 Hz without experiencing aliasing. If the algorithm detects a participant moving at a frequency exceeding 12.5 Hz, the resulting observation will manifest as an alias feature in the spectrum. However previous studies have reported that common human movement predominantly occur within a frequency range between 0-12.5 Hz [38]. Given this observation, we posit that any high-frequency movement beyond the 12.5 Hz threshold will exert minimal influence on algorithmic performance, as it lies outside the typical range of human movement. Furthermore, studies have shown that during the clonic phase the body’s major muscle groups exhibit repetitive convulsions at a frequency range between 3-8 Hz, which is inside the algorithms detectable frequency range [39] [40]. The frequency resolution of the spectrum is then determined by di- viding the sample frequency (25 Hz) by the number of measurements (125) per timestep, resulting in a resolution of 0.2 Hz. This resolu- tion allows for effective detection and differentiation of frequency components with a precision of 0.2 Hz. These calculations indicate that the algorithm can accurately identify frequency components that are spaced at intervals of 0.2 Hz, however any frequency differences smaller than this value may not be distinguishable [41]. To detect a ’seizure-like’ movement, the algorithm calculates the average power for the whole spectrum (Ps) and then the average power of the 3-8 Hz Region of Interest (Proi) for each timestep. To reduce the FAR, (Ps) is checked against a threshold to ensure that there is a sufficient level of movement, thus avoiding spurious alarms caused by measurement noise when there is minimal movement. If the movement detected exceeds the movement threshold, then Rroi is calculated as the ratio between (Proi) and (Ps) which can be expressed as Rroi = Proi Ps (2) A seizure is then detected if Rroi ≥the algorithms sensitivity threshold. If the sensitivity threshold is exceeded for three consecutive timesteps, an alarm state is raised, and the data saved to the database. Three consecutive timesteps (15 seconds) were utilised to give bal- ance between reducing false alarms and ensuring prompt generation of an alarm when a genuine seizure was detected. The above process is detailed in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 Pseudo code for the OSD algorithm where At = acceleration (vector magnitude) at timestep t, Ps = spectrum power, Proi = Region of Interest power, Rroi = ROI Ratio, Th = threshold.

XX, NO. XX, XXXX 2017 Fig. 7: A hierarchical overview of the file structure and core compo- nents of the Open Seizure Database and Open Seizure Toolkit IV. THE OPEN SEIZURE TOOLKIT The Open Seizure Toolkit is a software package developed by OSD, serving to facilitate data access to the OSDB, enabling the analysis and development of seizure detection models compatible with the OSD Android application. Fig.7 depicts the hierarchical structure of the OSTK, which encompasses three primary components (NN Trainer, Test Runner, and Data Summariser) located in the User Tools directory. To access the OSDB, users are required to clone the OSTK repository from the official OSD GitHub Repository. Additionally, data access requires user registration with OSD and compliance with the guidelines specified in the OSDB licence [43]. The following section illustrates the functionality of the OSTK by conducting a series of experiments to developing a basic seizure detection model compatible with the OSD Android application. For this experiment a subset of 190 events were selected from 16 participants diagnosed with different epilepsy types. A. Preprocessing and Data Engineering By utilising the OSTK WebApi connector, data was extracted as a JSON string and subsequently transformed by flattening the hierarchical structure of the data’s nested objects and loaded as a dataframe for manipulation. Data cleaning, analysis, and feature engineering were conducted to prepare the data for classification. To address the issue of imbalanced data, random oversampling was applied to the minority class. In order to mitigate the effects of data duplication resulting from oversampling, Gaussian noise was introduced to the ACM data as a form of data augmentation, thereby enhancing the variability among samples. B. Class Relabelling and One Hot Encoding In this experiment, one-hot encoding was used to convert 24 class categorical class labels into a binary vector representation. The resulting binary vectors contain all zero values except for the index corresponding to the class label, which is set to 1. The nnTrainer.py and processing pipeline.py scripts were then used to partition the subset into a 75:25 split for the training and test sets, respectively. C. Neural Network Trainer In this experiment, a 1-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) was developed, featuring four convolutional blocks la- belled as b1, b2, b3, b4, each with an associated filter size of 64, Fig. 8: Architectural schematic of 1D Convolutional Neural Network 128, 128, and 256, respectively, providing varying levels of recep- tivity (Fig.8). Each block contains a convolutional layer with ReLU activation and batch normalisation to capture spatial dependencies. Furthermore, a max pooling layer was added to each block to reduce spatial dimensionality. The output vector from b4 is flattened and fed into the models classification block which has three dense layers. The first two dense layers contain 128 fully connected neurons with ReLU activation units, while the third layer incorporates a softmax activation function to produce an output vector of multiple probabilities. Cate- gorical cross-entropy loss was used to optimise the learning process in conjunction with the Adam optimisation technique. To enhance numerical stability, the optimiser’s epsilon score and learning rate were reduced to 1e-05 and 0.0001, respectively. The toolkit can be used to visualise the models learning rate by plotting accuracy and loss scores for training and validation sets (Fig.9-10).

EXPERIMENTS & RESULTS This section presents the experiments conducted using the OSTK and and the results achieved. The 1D CNN was trained for 50 epochs, and recorded accuracy and loss scores of 0.959 and 0.1412 receptivity. The model was then evaluated on an unseen test set, and recorded an accuracy score of 92.75% with 0.298 loss. A full breakdown of the models overall performance is detailed in TABLE VII. The OSTK Data Summariser was utilised to plot a multi-class confusion matrix, visualising the model’s predicted and ground truth labels for the 24 classes used in these experiments. An analysis of the confusion matrix demonstrated how well the model distinguishes between the different classes. For the ”O Seizure” class, 810 true positives (TP) were accurately detected, however, 48 instances of ”Tonic-Clonic,” 15 ”Aura/focal,” and 58 ”Atonic/fall” were misclassified. Additionally, 8 instances were labelled as ”Sleeping” and 13 as ”Other”. Further analysis of the ”Tonic-Clonic” class classified 743 TP in- stances. However, 7 instances were misclassified as ”Other Seizure,” 7 as ”Aura/focal” and 18 as ”Atonic/fall”. Furthermore, 14 instances were incorrectly labelled as common human movements, with 9 instances labelled as ”Sleeping” and 5 as ”Other”. An analysis of the ”Atonic/fall” class revealed 734 TP instances, with only 2 instances inaccurately classified as ”Aura/focal”. More- over, a single instance each of ”Tonic-Clonic” and ”Unknown” were misclassified, whilst there were no incorrect classifications associated with the ”Other Seizure” class. These results demonstrate the model’s ability to differentiate between ”Atonic/fall” and ”Other Seizure” classes. For the ”Aura/focal” class, the model accurately identified 897 TP instances. However, 56 instances were incorrectly labelled as ”Atonic/focal”, 25 as ”Other Seizure” and 115 as ”Tonic-Clonic”. A further 13 labels were incorrectly classified as ”Unknown”, 27 as ”sleeping” and 60 as ”Other”. However, these findings were expected, as a considerable proportion of GTC seizures exhibit an aura (pre- ictal) phase. A further analysis shows that GTC seizures have an average clonic phase lasting 25 to 35 seconds after generalisation. Therefore a degree of similarity between these classes is to be expected and highlights the importance of considering the dynamics of each sub-event. Overall the model has demonstrated a clear ability to differentiate between the ”Other Seizure” and ”Atonic/fall” classes, as well as ”Aura/focal” and ”Atonic/fall”. However, there were chal- lenges distinguishing between the ”Tonic-Clonic” and ”Aura/focal” classes.

For the purpose of these experiments, the results will be focused on the four classes of seizure. For the ”Tonic-Clonic” class denoted in the results as c21, the model achieved a precision score of 0.94 and a recall of 0.77. These metrics signify that 86% of positive predictions were correct, while the recall indicates that 23% of true instances of c21 were incorrectly classified. For c2 (Aura), the model demonstrated a precision of 0.75, indicating that 75% of the instances predicted were correct. However the recall score of 0.93 highlights the model’s ability to correctly identify 93% of actual instances of c2. An analysis of c1 (Atonic/fall) recorded a precision score of 0.99, signifying that 99% of the instances predicted as c1 were true instances. Nonetheless, a recall score of 0.76 suggests that the model is overcompensating and classifying to many instances of c1, which has lead to a trade-off between the precision and recall scores. For c4 (Other Seizure), the model displayed a balanced performance, recording a precision, recall, and F1-score of 0.84. A precision score of 84% indicates a relatively low false positive rate and demonstrates a high level of accuracy when classifying classifying TP instances of c4. Furthermore, a recall score of 84% demonstrated the number of true instances correctly classified by c4. To provide a comprehensive assessment, an F1-score was computed for each class type, resulting in values of 0.86, 0.83, 0.84, and 0.85 for c1, c2, c4 and c21, respectively. F1-score results indicate a realistic trade-off between correctly identifying positive instances (recall) and minimising false positives (precision) for each class. In summary, the model’s performance demonstrates a clear ability to accurately classify seizure-related classes while maintaining a balance between precision and recall.

"The primary objective of this research is to address the scarcity of resources in the field of non-EEG seizure detection by establishing the OSDB as the first openly accessible database encompassing non-EEG sensor data from multiple sensing modalities. This study distinguishes itself by utilising real-world data, provid- ing an accurate depiction of everyday life compared to controlled EMU-based datasets. The beta trial’s success led to an indefinite extension of the data collection period, showcasing our commitment to continually enriching the OSDB and contributing to non-EEG seizure detection research. The initial version of the OSDB is comprised of 494 events collected over 453 days, with each event labelled and optimised for machine/deep learning. Among these events, 146 epileptic seizures were recorded; 50 GTC seizures, 47 Other seizures, 27 aura/focal, and 22 atonic/falls. The cumulative duration of recorded epileptic events amounts to 5 hours, 51 minutes, making it the most extensive publicly available cohort of non-EEG seizure data to date. Additionally, 302 common human movements that triggered false alarms during the data collection period were recorded and labelled. A further 46 events were classified as false alarms, where the triggering activity remains unidentified. The inclusion of labelled false alarms in the dataset offers a valuable resource to address the challenge of false positives in non-EEG seizure detection. A. Future Research The introduction of the OSDB sets forth several possibilities for future research. As the data collection process is extended indefinitely, individuals with epilepsy can continue to participate and contribute data. As more data is collected, the exploration of novel techniques such as patient-specific and seizure-specific detection becomes a possibility. However, due to the dataset’s current size, dedicated classification models cannot be trained for these concepts yet. Nev- ertheless, as more data accumulates over time, these concepts will become feasible. VII. CONCLUSION In conclusion, the introduction of the OSDB and OSTK represents a significant milestone in non-EEG seizure detection research, providing a valuable resource to overcome existing scarcity in this domain. With real-world data collected from in-home environments, researchers can explore diverse multimodal approaches for seizure detection. The OSDBs extensive data on epileptic seizures and labelled false alarms presents a unique opportunity to advance the field. With continued data collection and exploration of novel techniques, the OSDB and OSTK has the promise of establishing a non-EEG gold standard and ultimately improving seizure detection techniques. Researchers investigating non-EEG detection can access the dataset, code, and models through the official OSDB GitHub repository. Acknowledgements: A heartfelt thank you to all the participants.

Reconfiguring processes within regulatory bodies like the FDA to incorporate racial equity considerations during device approval can help rectify deficits in representation and ensure accurate functionality across diverse populations [56]. Moreover, initiatives to augment research funding for developing inclusive devices and interventions to mitigate disparities in telehealth usage are indispensable in advancing equitable access to digital health technologies [56]. Experts caution that access to wearables could evolve into a social determinant of health, underscoring the urgency of addressing barriers such as cost, awareness, and language to facilitate broad community participation in digital health initiatives [57]. Strategies encompassing educational outreach, public or private financial investments, and cultural sensitivity play a pivotal role in fostering the widespread adoption of digital health devices across diverse populations [57]. Through collaborative efforts and targeted interventions, stakeholders can work toward dismantling barriers and ensuring all individuals have equal access to the transformative benefits of wearable technology in healthcare. Conclusions In conclusion, this review has illuminated the pivotal role of wearable digital health technology in managing epilepsy, addressing the challenges inherent in traditional approaches while presenting new opportunities for personalised care. By harnessing continuous monitoring and real-time data collection, these devices offer invaluable insights into seizure patterns and trends, empowering patients and healthcare providers to make informed decisions and take proactive measures. The implications for clinical practice are profound, as wearable technology enables more comprehensive and timely interventions, potentially leading to improved outcomes and quality of life for individuals with epilepsy. However, to fully realise the potential of wearable devices in epilepsy management, further research is warranted. Validation studies, longitudinal research, user-centred design, interoperability enhancements, and regulatory considerations are all critical areas for future exploration and development. Through collaborative efforts and a commitment to innovation, we can advance the wearable digital health technology field and continue to enhance epilepsy care, ultimately 2024 Ahuja et al.

"Detecting Epileptic Seizures With Multimodal Non-EEG Data From Wearables DISSERTATION zur Erlangung des Grades eines Doktors der Ingenieurwissenschaften eingereicht bei der Naturwissenschaftlich-Technischen Fakultät der Universität Siegen von Sebastian Böttcher Siegen 2023 Detecting Epileptic Seizures With Multimodal Non-EEG Data From Wearables DISSERTATION for the degree of Doctor of Engineering Sciences submitted to the School of Science and Technology at the University of Siegen by Sebastian Böttcher Siegen 2023 Created with LATEX on 2023-07-05 22:12:23+02:00 This document is not digitally signed and may have been altered Betreuer und erster Gutachter Supervisor and first reviewer Prof. Dr. Kristof Van Laerhoven Universität Siegen Zweiter Gutachter Second reviewer Prof. Dr. Björn Eskofier Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg Tag der mündlichen Prüfung Day of the defense 19 May 2023 Zusammenfassung E pilepsie ist eine der am weitesten verbreiteten chronischen neurologischen Erkrankun- gen, von der weltweit Millionen von Menschen aus allen Gesellschaftsschichten betrof- fen sind. Epilepsie äußert sich bei den Betroffenen durch wiederkehrende Anfälle mit einer Reihe unterschiedlicher Symptome, in wechselnden Abständen und mit variabler Ausprägung. Der Goldstandard zur Diagnose und Beobachtung von Epilepsie ist die Video-Elektroenze- phalografie. Dabei werden Epilepsiepatienten einige Tage lang überwacht während Ärzte mit verschiedenen Mitteln Anfälle auslösen, in der Hoffnung, genügend Informationen für eine präzise Diagnose und Behandlung zu erhalten. Dieses Verfahren ist jedoch im täglichen Leben der Patienten und über längere Zeiträume hinweg nicht sinnvoll. Darüber hinaus haben sich die handschriftlichen Tagebücher, die manche Patienten führen, als unzuverlässig erwiesen, da sie die Zahl der Anfälle in der Regel stark unterbewerten. Es wird also eine Alternative für die Ultra-Langzeit-Überwachung benötigt, um die gängigen Behandlungen zu verbessern und die Entwicklung neuer Therapieoptionen zu erleichtern. Diese Dissertation untersucht das Potenzial multimodaler, nicht-elektroenzephalografischer, von tragbaren Geräten aufgezeich- neter Daten zur Anfallserkennung für automatische Anfallstagebücher. Darüber hinaus wird eine mögliche Anwendung der Anfallserkennung als Teil eines automatischen Alarmsystems untersucht. Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wurde ein neuer Datensatz von Biosignaldaten erstellt und ver- wendet, aufgezeichnet in zwei europäischen Epilepsiezentren im Rahmen eines europäischen Forschungsprojekts. Mehr als 200 Epilepsiepatienten wurden in den beiden Einrichtungen rekrutiert, und mehr als 300 epileptische Anfälle unterschiedlicher Art wurden mit einem trag- baren Gerät aufgezeichnet. Dabei wurde das Empatica E4 verwendet, ein für die Forschung geeignetes, am Handgelenk getragenes Wearable das Biosignale der Bewegung, der elektri- schen Hautleitfähigkeit und des Blutvolumenpulses erfasst. Diese Daten bildeten für mehrere Studien, die sich mit der Bewertung von Methoden zur Erkennung von epileptischen Anfällen befassten, die Grundlage zur Datenanalyse. Die vorliegende Arbeit fasst mehrere Beiträge des Autors zur Erkennung epileptischer mo- torischer Anfälle mit multimodalen nicht-elektroenzephalografischen Daten von Wearables zusammen. Die enthaltenen Studien untersuchten insbesondere solche Anfälle mit Bewe- gungsmanifestationen in den Gliedmaßen und es wurde festgestellt, dass bestimmte Erken- nungssysteme die auf maschinellem Lernen unter Verwendung physiologischer Biosignal- daten basieren gut geeignet sind. vii viii Ein zentraler Teil dieser Arbeit befasst sich mit krampfartigen tonisch-klonischen An- fällen, also schweren und gefährlichen Anfällen die in beiden Gehirnhälften beginnen oder sich dorthin ausbreiten. Während dieser Anfälle ist das Bewusstsein des betroffenen Patien- ten beeinträchtigt und es kommt zu hochamplitudigen, hochfrequenten Zuckungen der Glied- maßen und am gesamten Körper. In einer der hier vorgestellten Studien wurde eine automa- tische Erkennungsmethode auf Grundlage einer Kombination aus Beschleunigungsmessung und elektrodermalen Aktivitätssignalen bewertet. Ein maschinelles Lernmodell wurde auf Experten-markierten Daten trainiert und anhand einer dem Modell unbekannten Testgruppe bewertet. Die Leistung des Modells ist mindestens gleichwertig mit dem Stand der Technik, bei einer korrekten Erkennung von über 90 Prozent der Anfallsereignisse und einer Fehlalarm- rate von weniger als 0,5 Prozent pro Tag. Die vorgeschlagene Methodik schneidet außerdem besser ab als das durchschnittliche monomodale Erkennungssystem aus vergleichbaren Stu- dien. Auf konvulsive tonisch-klonische Anfälle folgt in der Regel eine Phase der Bewegungs- und Bewusstlosigkeit, wodurch das Risiko eines plötzlichen unerwarteten Todes bei Epilep- sie erheblich erhöht ist. Eine weitere Studie untersucht die Brauchbarkeit von am Körper gemessenen Biosignaldaten, um diesen Zeitraum der Bewusstlosigkeit mithilfe einer heuris- tischen Erkennung basierend auf Beschleunigungssignalen zu erkennen und einzuschätzen. In Abhängigkeit von einer vorherigen automatischen Erkennung des Anfalls war die Methode in der Lage, alle Fälle von Unbeweglichkeit im Datensatz korrekt zu klassifizieren. Ein weiterer wesentlicher Teil dieser Arbeit befasst sich mit der Erkennung fokaler An- fälle anhand von Daten aus Wearables. Fokale Anfälle haben, über verschiedene Patienten hinweg betrachtet, typischerweise sehr heterogene Symptome. Diese umfassen verschiedene Arten von Körperbewegungen, Reaktionen des autonomen Nervensystems und psychologis- che Veränderungen. In der hier einbezogenen Forschung wurden nur solche fokalen Anfälle mit spezifischen Bewegungen der Gliedmaßen analysiert. Eine erste explorative Studie unter- suchte die Auswirkungen der hohen Varianz fokaler motorischer Anfälle auf relevante Biosig- nale und die Anfallserkennung mit diesen. In einer weiteren Studie wurden dann individu- alisierte und generische Modelle zur Erkennung fokaler motorischer Anfälle auf der Grund- lage der vom Wearable aufgezeichneten Biosignale untersucht. Die Studie ergab, dass die op- tisch gemessenen Blutvolumenpulsdaten stark durch Bewegungsartefakte beeinträchtigt sind. Darüber hinaus schnitten generische Modelle deutlich schlechter ab als patientenspezifische Modelle und wiesen hohe Fehlalarmraten auf. Daher sind für die Erkennung fokaler Anfälle maßgeschneiderte Erkennungsmodelle für einzelne Patienten, und zwar speziell für eine Un- tergruppe von Epilepsiepatienten bei denen charakteristische Anfälle auftreten, wahrschein- lich die robusteste Methode. Diese Arbeit kommt zu dem Schluss, dass generische Anfallserkennungsmodelle zwar für hoch-konvulsive Anfälle und unter Krankenhausbedingungen ausreichend sein können, dass sie aber derzeit nicht für die Erkennung fokaler Anfälle mit weniger oder gar keinen Bewegungen geeignet sind. Umgekehrt sind patientenspezifische Erkennungsmethoden für nicht-konvulsive motorische Anfälle vielversprechend. Erkennungsmodelle, die sich im Laufe der Zeit individualisieren, könnten letztendlich die beste Option für ambulante Anfallserken- nung werden. In den hier einbezogenen Studien wurden insbesondere Erkennungssysteme untersucht, die auf maschinellem Lernen unter Verwendung physiologischer Biosignaldaten basieren. Die Ergebnisse zeigten, dass diese Systeme für die Erkennung von konvulsiven An- fällen und solchen mit leichteren Bewegungen der Gliedmaßen geeignet sind. Abstract E pilepsy is one of the most prevalent chronic neurological disorders, affecting millions worldwide throughout all societal groups. Epilepsy manifests in those affected as reoc- curring seizures with a wide range of different symptoms at variable intervals and severity. The current gold standard to diagnose and monitor epilepsy is video-electroencephalography.","What is the main focus and contribution of Sebastian Böttcher's dissertation, titled ""Detecting Epileptic Seizures With Multimodal Non-EEG Data From Wearables,"" submitted to the School of Science and Technology at the University of Siegen in 2023?",de,"The main focus and contribution of Sebastian Böttcher's dissertation, titled ""Detecting Epileptic Seizures With Multimodal Non-EEG Data From Wearables,"" submitted to the School of Science and Technology at the University of Siegen in 2023, lies in proposing a method for detecting epileptic seizures using multimodal non-EEG data from wearable devices. This approach aims to provide an alternative or supplementary tool for diagnosing and observing epilepsy, as Video-Electroencephalography (VEEG) is currently the gold standard but requires patients to be monitored over several days under medical supervision. The dissertation seeks to address this limitation by leveraging data from wearable devices that can be continuously worn by the patient, potentially enabling more practical and less intrusive seizure detection and monitoring.","Sebastian Böttcher's dissertation aims to develop a method for detecting epileptic seizures using data from wearable devices, other than EEG."
"Patients with epilepsy visit monitoring units for a few days, and clinicians provoke seizures through various means, hoping to get enough information for precise diagnosis and treat- ment. However, this procedure is not viable during the patients’ daily lives and over more extended periods. Furthermore, the handwritten diaries that some patients keep have proven unreliable, typically severely under-counting the number of seizures occurring. An alterna- tive for ultra-long-term monitoring is needed to improve current treatments and facilitate the development of new therapy options. This thesis investigates the potential of multimodal non- electroencephalography data recorded from wearable devices as a tool for seizure detection in the context of automated seizure diaries. It furthermore explores a potential application of seizure detection in the context of an automatic alarm system. The work featured in this thesis produces and employs a new data set of wearable biosig- nal data, recorded at two European epilepsy centers in the context of a European collaborative research project. Over 200 patients with epilepsy were recruited at the two epilepsy moni- toring units, and over 300 epileptic seizures of varying types were recorded with a wearable device. Here, the Empatica E4 is used, a research-grade wrist-worn wearable that captures the biosignal modalities of accelerometry (movement), electrodermal activity (electrical skin conductance), and blood volume pulse (optical pulse measurement via photoplethysmogra- phy). This data set was the basis for several data analysis studies concerning the evaluation of seizure detection methodologies. This thesis compiles and provides a framework for several contributions of the author concerning the detection of epileptic motor seizures with multimodal non-electroencepha- lography data from wearables. Specifically, the included studies investigated those seizures with movement manifestations in the limbs and found detection systems based on supervised ensemble machine learning using physiological biosignal data to be viable. One central part of this thesis is focused on convulsive tonic-clonic seizures, severe and dangerous seizures that start in or progress to both hemispheres of the brain. During these seizures, the awareness and consciousness of the affected patient are impaired, and high-am- plitude, high-frequency jerks of the limbs and whole body occur. One of the studies presented ix x here assessed an automatic detection methodology based on a combination of accelerometry and electrodermal activity signals. A supervised ensemble machine learning model is trained on expert-labeled data and evaluated on an out-of-sample test set. It performs at least on par with state-of-the-art related work, correctly classifying more than 90 percent of seizure events with false alarm rates of less than 0.5 per day. The suggested methodology performs better than the average monomodal detection system in related work. Convulsive tonic-clonic seizures are typically followed by a period of unconsciousness and immobility, significantly increasing the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. A further study investigates the utility of wearable biosignal data to detect and gauge this period based on a heuristic detection using accelerometry signals. Contingent on a prior automatic detection of the seizure, the methodology was able to classify all instances of immobility in the data set correctly. Another essential segment of this thesis highlights the detection of focal seizures with data from wearables. Focal seizures typically have very heterogeneous symptoms when re- garded across patients. They include body movements of different kinds, responses of the autonomic nervous system, and psychological indications. The research included here an- alyzed only those focal seizures with specific movements of the limbs. An early exploratory study investigated the impact of the high variance of focal motor seizures on biosignals and the performance of seizure detection based on those signals. An additional study then considered individualized and generic models for detecting focal motor seizures based on the biosignals recorded by the wearable. The study found the optically measured blood volume pulse data to be highly impacted by noise from motion artifacts. Furthermore, generic models performed considerably worse than those specific to an individual patient, with high false alarm rates. Thus, for focal seizure detection, custom-made detection models for individual patients are likely to be the most robust methodology, and are specifically suitable for a subset of patients with epilepsy who experience characteristic seizures. This thesis concludes that while generic seizure detection models may be sufficient for highly convulsive seizures and under in-hospital conditions, they are currently not feasible for detecting focal seizures with fewer or no movements. Conversely, patient-specific detec- tion methodologies are promising for non-convulsive motor seizures. Detection models that individualize over time may eventually become the best option for ultra-long-term seizure de- tection. Specifically, the included studies investigated detection systems based on supervised ensemble machine learning using physiological biosignal data. Results showed them to be feasible for detecting convulsive and less-convulsive seizures with manifestations including movements of the limbs.

INTRODUCTION E pilepsy is one of the most prevalent chronic neurological disorders, with a worldwide in- cidence of up to 100 per 100,000 people per year, affecting over 70 million people. Several different types of epilepsy have been identified, manifesting in different symptoms, character- istically in seizures of varying severity. Seizures are typically involuntary movements of the whole body or parts of it, sometimes accompanied by a loss of consciousness. The current gold standard in epilepsy diagnosis and seizure monitoring is in-hospital video-electroencephalog- raphy. Patients with epilepsy are often diagnosed in epilepsy monitoring units over the course of several days. However, while being accurate and widely used for the diagnosis of epilepsy and the determination of treatment, this methodology is only feasible in relatively short-term applications. Thus, seizure monitoring at home in an ultra-long-term context, that is, over a period of multiple days or longer, is needed. Patients with epilepsy typically keep handwritten diaries of their seizure events. However, these diaries have proven unreliable and incomplete, especially when a loss of consciousness accompanies epileptic seizures. Wearable devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers, which are readily available to a broad audience, may fill this gap in monitoring. They may automatically detect and log seizures of epilepsy patients in their day-to-day environment and serve as an automatic alarm to potentially alert caregivers in the event of a seizure. This thesis aims to explore the feasibility of epileptic seizure detection using wearable devices and biosignal sensors in the context of automated diaries. Furthermore, it investigates a potential application of seizure detection in the context of an automatic alarm system. During a six-year collaborative research project, an exhaustive set of biosignal data was collected from patients with epilepsy. Further, several scientific research studies were conducted and published. These studies primarily focused on evaluating seizure detection methodologies on the collected data, including seizures with movement symptoms of varying severity. For this purpose, multimodal non-electroencephalography biosignal data were collected with a wrist- worn research-grade wearable device. The following chapter introduces the basics of epilepsy, wearable data recording, and seizure detection and gives this thesis’s motivation and essential contributions. 1.1. FUNDAMENTALS OF EPILEPSY 3 1.1 Fundamentals of Epilepsy « The history of epilepsy can be summarised as 4000 years of ignorance, supersti- tion, and stigma followed by 100 years of knowledge, superstition, and stigma. » — Rajendra Kale, 1997 [1] Epilepsy and its symptoms have been part of medical texts since the beginning of recorded history [2, 3]. Some of the earliest accounts of apparent epileptic seizures date as far back as ca. 2000 b.c. [4], while epilepsy as a human condition is first described in some early Babylo- nian medical records, ca. 1000 b.c. [3, 4]. The condition was generally regarded as a divine, spiritual affliction until its first description as a medical disease in On the Sacred Disease, at- tributed to Hippocrates, ca. 400 b.c. [4]. Nevertheless, misunderstanding and stigmatization of the epileptic condition continued throughout the Middle Ages, and only modern scientific medicine started to acknowledge its neurological origins. The first anticonvulsive medications used in epilepsy were Bromide in 1857 and Phenobarbital in 1912 [5]. Since then, many differ- ent anti-epileptic drugs and treatments have been developed and improved [6].","What are the key topics discussed in the chapter titled ""Fundamentals of Wearable Biosignal Recording"" within this document, specifically focusing on its relation to epilepsy?",en,"The chapter titled ""Fundamentals of Wearable Biosignal Recording,"" as mentioned in the text provided, discusses key topics related to wearable devices and their role in the context of epilepsy. Specifically, it covers:

1. Basics of Epilepsy (Fundamentals of Epilepsy): This section provides a brief overview of what epilepsy is, its characteristics, diagnosis, monitoring, management, and treatment.

2. Fundamentals of Wearable Biosignal Recording: This part delves into the technical aspects of using wearable devices for biosignal recording in relation to epilepsy. It likely includes discussions on the types of signals that can be recorded, the quality of data collected, and the challenges associated with this approach.

3. Although not explicitly mentioned in the text provided, it is also reasonable to assume that this section may cover the importance of wearable devices for real-time monitoring of epileptic seizures, as well as their potential role in early detection and intervention.","This chapter discusses fundamentals related to wearable biosignal recording in the context of epilepsy, including its basics and how it relates to seizure detection."
"However, even today, epilepsy remains a prevalent, albeit often treatable, neurological disorder, and patients with epilepsy (PWEs) are still stigmatized and discriminated against [7]. 1.1.1 What is Epilepsy? Epilepsy is clinically defined as a disease generally identified if two unprovoked seizures oc- cur more than one day apart or if there is a reasonably heightened risk of subsequent seizures after an initial one [8]. The origin of an individual’s epilepsy can be genetic, acquired, or un- known, and in many cases, is caused by a combination of these factors [9]. Various conditions may cause acquired epilepsy, including strokes, tumors, brain trauma, and nervous system infections [10]. The neurological mechanism of an epileptic seizure is described as the abnormal and un- controlled firing of neurons in the brain, disrupting the regular and organized brain activity. The source of this anomalous activity, that is, the seizure, is called the focus, and the onset and offset are the start and end times of the seizure. The focus of the seizure can be limited to one specific location of the brain, or span large areas of both hemispheres of the brain, describing focal seizures or generalized seizures, respectively (see also Section 1.1.2). The whole period of the seizure between onset and offset is called the ictal1 period, with a typical duration of a few seconds to many minutes. The onset and offset of the seizure are thereby determined by clinicians reviewing the electroencephalography (EEG) signal. The periods immediately preceding and following the seizure are denoted pre-ictal and post-ictal, respectively. The pre- ictal phase can include symptoms such as behavioral or cognitive changes [11] and changes in heart rate (HR) [12]. In the post-ictal phase clinical symptoms of the seizure itself, such as cognitive impairments, often remain beyond the EEG-offset of the seizure. The time from one post-ictal to the next pre-ictal phase is called the inter-ictal period. Pre- and post-ictal phases are not necessarily defined in length and can vary greatly, depending on the relevant context. Specifically, while the end of the pre-ictal phase and the beginning of the post-ictal phase are usually well-defined (as the beginning and end of the ictal phase), the transitions between inter-ictal and pre- or post-ictal phases are often ambiguous. For example, 1From Latin ictus: blow, stroke 4 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION ictal post-ictal pre-ictal ictal post-ictal pre-ictal inter-ictal inter-ictal inter-ictal inter-ictal peri-ictal Figure 1.1: Schematic overview of the typical seizure phases, showing two distinct seizures (ictal), the periods before and after (pre- and post-ictal), and the periods in between seizures (inter-ictal). after some seizures neither the clinicians nor the patients themselves can accurately pinpoint the end of all related symptoms. Nevertheless, the whole phase from the start of the pre-ictal to the end of the post-ictal period is sometimes called peri-ictal [13]. Figure 1.1 gives a simplified overview of the different seizure phases and their temporal relation to each other. With a worldwide incidence of up to 100 new cases per 100,000 people per year and af- fecting over 70 million people worldwide, epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders [14, 15]. At any given time, an estimated 4 to 10 per 1,000 people have epilepsy, that is, are at risk of continuing seizures and needing treatment [16]. Epilepsy is more common in men than in women, in children than in adults, and in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries [17]. Furthermore, concerning the three differentiated epilepsy origins, the estimated prevalence of epilepsy with unknown origin is highest, followed by acquired epilepsy and epilepsy due to genetic disposition [15, 17]. While the overall risk of death from epilepsy is generally considered low, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is still a serious and considerable outcome of epileptic seizures, espe- cially of those that are severely convulsive [15]. SUDEP incidence varies in range by age and gender, with estimates at around 1.2 per 1000 PWEs per year [18, 19]. Furthermore, increased mortality rates are associated with risk factors such as alcohol misuse, missed anticonvulsant drug prescriptions, injuries, or depression [20]. Overall, compared to the general populace, the risk of premature death is up to three times higher for PWEs [16]. 1.1.2 Epileptic Seizures An epileptic seizure is an occurrence of symptoms due to abnormal neuronal activity in the brain [21]. Epileptic seizures can manifest in various symptoms [22], which can change over time in individual patients, especially children [23]. The expression of an epileptic seizure as a group of symptoms is also called semiology1. As the management and treatment of epilepsy can vary according to which type of symptoms occur, and some non-epileptic seizures exist, a classification of seizures into a specific set of categories can be of utmost importance. Over time there has been a miscellany of different seizure type classifications [24–26], with the latest being the 2017 Operational classification of seizure types by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) [27]. However, terminology from older classifications is sometimes still in use. 1From Ancient Greek s¯emeîon: sign; lógos: explanation 1.1. FUNDAMENTALS OF EPILEPSY 5 Onset Focal Focal to Bilateral Generalized Unknown Manifestation Motor — hyperkinetic / clonic / tonic automatisms myoclonic atonic Non-Motor — autonomic (e.g. tachycardia) cognitive aura (e.g. emotional / sensory) Motor — tonic-clonic clonic / tonic / myoclonic atonic Non-Motor — absence Motor — tonic / clonic / spasms Non-Motor — behavior arrest Motor — tonic-clonic Awareness Aware or Impaired Impaired Aware or Impaired Impaired Figure 1.2: Schematic overview of different seizure types by onset, manifestation, and aware- ness, according to the ILAE 2017 Classification of Seizure Types Expanded Version. See also Fisher et al. [27], Figure 2. Unless otherwise stated or referencing older publications, this thesis will use the 2017 ILAE seizure type classification, illustrated in Figure 1.2. The most widely and colloquially known seizure type is that of the generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) [28]. As a generalized seizure, it onsets throughout the brain and progresses from the tonic1 phase, a brief tensing of skeletal muscles in the limbs and throughout the body, to the clonic2 phase with prolonged, violent, and rapid convulsions of the muscles [22].",Qu'est-ce que l'épilepsie et quelles peuvent être les causes de son apparition ?,en,"L'épilepsie est une maladie du système nerveux marquée par la survenue d'au moins deux crises épileptiques non provoquées qui se produisent à plus d'un jour d'intervalle les unes des autres, ou bien lorsque le risque de crise épileptique est considéré comme élevé après une première crise. Les origines de l'épilepsie peuvent provenir de facteurs génétiques, acquis ou inconnus. Dans de nombreux cas, l'épilepsie est causée par une combinaison de ces facteurs. Des conditions diverses peuvent entraîner l'épilepsie acquise, notamment les accidents vasculaires cérébraux (AVC), les tumeurs cérébrales, des traumatismes du système nerveux et des infections du système nerveux.","Epilepsie est une maladie neurologique caractérisée par des crises généralement définies par au moins deux crises non déclenchées survenue plus d'un jour ou un risque élevé de récidive après une première.

Les conditions pouvant causer l'épilepsie acquise incluent des AVC, tumeurs cérébrales, traumatismes cérébraux et infections du système nerveux."
"GTCSs typically last no longer than 1 to 2 minutes, are accompanied by tachycardia3 and impaired awareness, and are often followed by a period of unconsciousness [22, 29]. Directly related to GTCSs are focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (FBTCSs), which have a focal onset and typically progress to generalization during the tonic phase but are often indistinguishable 1From Ancient Greek tónos: tension 2From Ancient Greek klónos: confused motion, trembling 3Heart rate exceeding the normal resting baseline 6 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION from GTCSs [30]. As such, GTCSs and FBTCSs are major risk factors concerning SUDEP [19]. While there are other types of generalized seizures like generalized absences, they are much less frequent in the data sets included for this thesis and are not further detailed here. Contrary to GTCSs and FBTCSs, focal seizures (FSs) have a localized onset in the brain and do not progress over both hemispheres. FSs are less well-known to the public than GTCSs, and their often less severe manifestations are also not as prevalent in the general media coverage concerning epilepsy [28]. Nevertheless, they make up a considerable portion of seizures [15]. They are much more varied in their manifestations than GTCSs, as symptoms can depend on the localization of the focus in the brain [31]. Seizure classifications generally subdivide FSs by the awareness status of the patient and the occurrence of motor symptoms during the seizure [27]. Older seizure classifications designated focal seizures without impairment of awareness as simple partial seizures, and those where the consciousness is impacted as com- plex partial seizures [25]. However, those notations are not used anymore in current literature in favor of more verbose descriptions of the seizures [32]. Any combination of awareness, motor, and non-motor manifestation can occur during the same seizure. Among possible variants of FSs, those with tonic or clonic motor features, or both, are closest to GTCSs concerning manifestation and thus also wearable monitoring. While the patterns of movement during the ictal phase mimic those during a GTCS, these seizures are much less violently convulsive than their generalized counterparts. Moreover, they are usually not followed by a period of unconsciousness. Overall, possible motor manifestations in FSs can include the following features, roughly ordered by perceived severity of movement: Hyperkinetic: Intense, irregular, asymmetric, projecting, and violent movements of one or more limbs. Vocalization and fear are common non-motor symptoms accompanying hypermotor seizures [33]. Clonic: Regular and repeated alternation between tensing and relaxing muscles in one or more limbs. In focal clonic seizures, the patient usually maintains consciousness at seizure onset [22]. Tonic: Tensing of the muscles of one or more limbs. Tonic features are often a prelude to more intense clonic movements [22]. Automatism: Regular or complex movements of a specific body part, which can include the limbs or parts of the limbs, the head, the mouth, or the eyelids [22, 34]. Myoclonic: Very short single twitch of a body part, often repeated several times in quick succession within just a few seconds. They are most frequently associated with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, a genetic syndrome emerging in adolescents [35]. Atonic: Complete, involuntary relaxation of muscles in a part of or the whole body. The sudden loss of muscle control in atonic seizures substantially increases the risk of in- jury [36]. A similar array of possible symptoms exists regarding non-motor manifestations of FSs. The most common autonomic manifestation of epileptic seizures is tachycardia [29], which is often defined as an increase in HR above a certain absolute threshold or relative to a baseline. Various research has linked ictal and pre-ictal tachycardia to focal and generalized seizures [12, 1.1. FUNDAMENTALS OF EPILEPSY 7 29, 37], often coinciding with motor symptoms [38, 39]. Overall, three main classes of non- motor manifestations exist: Autonomic: Changes in the autonomic nervous system. Cardiac modulations like tachycar- dia and bradycardia are among the most investigated [40, 41], and others like electro- dermal activity changes are also prevalent [42, 43]. Cognitive: Impaired awareness or other cognitive dysfunctions of the patient. These symp- toms may not be tied to a single seizure but could be long-lasting or permanent impair- ments of the patient’s cognitive abilities [44, 45]. Aura: The patient experiences certain feelings, not necessarily directly measurable by biosig- nals. Among them are sensory auras (e.g., epigastric, olfactory, gustatory, auditory), emotional auras (e.g., pleasure, excitement, fear, anxiety), or psychic auras (e.g., disor- dered thoughts, déjà vu, hallucinations) [46, 47]. Short-term impaired awareness is a common symptom of any type of seizure, independent of other motor or non-motor manifestations. It can display as short-term memory loss, loss of speech, or other impairment of cognitive abilities and understanding of simple concepts [48]. These symptoms may also last for a short while after electrographic seizure offset [49]. Many seizures are left unclassified, especially in outpatient settings where the seizure was not wit- nessed by another person or recorded by video. Moreover, even under monitored conditions, some seizures cannot be associated with a defined seizure type category [27]. 1.1.3 Diagnosis, Monitoring, Management, and Treatment Diagnosis and Monitoring Epilepsy can be diagnosed in a clinical ambulatory setting by anamnesis, whereby a patient visits a neurologist and describes potential past seizures, genetic disposition, or other relevant circumstances that may lead to a diagnosis of epilepsy. Another common way to diagnose epilepsy and epileptic seizures, sometimes reinforcing findings concluded from anamnesis, is through differential diagnosis in an epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU), usually part of a hos- pital or medical center for neurological healthcare. The clinical gold standard for epilepsy monitoring in an EMU is video-electroencephalography (vEEG). The stay in an EMU typically ranges between two days and two weeks in duration, depending on the purpose of the visit and individual needs, although research has shown that the diagnostic yield in EMUs drops significantly after five days [50]. In a vEEG monitoring unit, clinical technicians attach a stan- dard array of EEG electrodes to the patient’s scalp, most often in a 10-20 pattern [51, 52], and a video camera is pointed towards the patient’s hospital bed, continuously recording during the monitoring phase.","What is the primary difference between generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs), focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (FBTCSs), and focal seizures (FSs) in terms of their onset, progression, and hemispheric involvement?",en,"The primary difference between generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs), focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (FBTCSs), and focal seizures (FSs) lies in their onset, progression, and hemispheric involvement. GTCSs and FBTCSs have a generalized onset across both hemispheres of the brain and may progress over both hemispheres during the seizure, while FSs originate from a localized area in one hemisphere and do not typically spread to the other hemisphere. Additionally, GTCSs and FBTCSs are often accompanied by a loss of awareness and impaired consciousness, whereas FSs can manifest with varying levels of awareness depending on their location within the brain.","GTCSs have a generalized onset, progress across both hemispheres, and may cause unconsciousness. FBTCSs start focally but become bilateral, while FSs originate locally and do not progress over both hemispheres."
"Depending on local practices and individual needs, the patients may be allowed to leave the hospital room for a short duration, removing themselves from the vEEG system. The EEG and video data are monitored around the clock by technicians or clinicians, and the patients have access to an alarm bell that can notify staff of an impending, ongoing, or passed seizure. Nevertheless, epileptic seizures themselves are very infrequent and take up relatively little time of an epilepsy patient’s lifetime. For example, one estimate from an ultra-long-term study puts the time spent having a seizure at only 0.05 % [53, 54]. Long-term monitoring of epilepsy 8 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION and (semi-)automatic detection of epileptic activity with EEG is possible, however, it often requires the patient to wear high-density EEG electrode arrays [55, 56], or have electrodes implanted [57, 58]. An additional practice of monitoring seizures, especially in an outpatient context, is keeping a seizure diary of manually recorded occurrences of seizures in the patient’s daily life. Systematic and long-term documentation of seizures is essential for therapeutic decision-making and clinical and pharmacological studies [59, 60]. As the primary aim of epilepsy treatment is for the patient to become seizure-free, correctly gauging the number of seizure occurrences is paramount to assessing the efficiency of a given treatment. Management and Treatment In modern medicine, there are several options to manage and treat epilepsy. Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) can potentially suppress seizures in two out of three PWEs, but they rarely change the long-term prognosis, which is most affected by epilepsy surgery [14]. In this pro- cess, vEEG monitoring units are essential for effectively treating PWEs. Differential diagnosis and pre-surgical evaluation are the most common reasons to visit an EMU. Patients selected for a surgical intervention based on their diagnosis undergo pre-surgical evaluation. To bet- ter understand their seizures in general and gain knowledge about the localization of seizure onsets to discover potential targets for resection, clinicians provoke seizures in a controlled environment through different means, such as reduction of AEDs, sleep deprivation, or stim- ulation with light pulses [61]. During seizures, the patients are cared for by specialized staff who monitor the seizure manifestation and progression and test for symptoms like muscle tensing or cognitive impairments. This information may help to identify the seizure type and onset localization. Resective epilepsy surgery is only relevant for patients who are AED-refractory, that is, who are not responding to AEDs, and for whom clinicians were able to define a focal seizure onset zone. The aim of the surgery is to potentially reduce or eliminate the recurrence of seizures [62]. During surgery, brain tissue is removed at the location of typical seizure onset while carefully weighing a positive outcome for the patient against minimizing the risk of further neurological damage. On average, between 25 % and 50 % of patients who underwent epilepsy surgery become free of seizures without needing AEDs, but this result can be delayed up to 5 years after surgery [62, 63]. A different method of managing and treating epilepsy and epileptic seizures is neurostim- ulation [64]. Clinicians usually administer this therapy to patients who are AED-refractory and for whom surgery is not an option. Generally, there are three types of neurostimulation frequently employed in epilepsy patients. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is the oldest type of stimulation and uses an extra-cranial methodology to stimulate the vagus nerve on a pre-programmed regular schedule. While VNS can significantly reduce seizure frequency in up to half of the treated population, it has common side effects like hoarseness and speech modulation, especially during stimulation phases [64, 65]. Conversely, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an intracranial stimulation technique that tar- gets a specific brain region to apply regular pulses of electricity, suppressing the propagation or even onset of epileptic seizures. DBS is a promising intervention method for drug-resistant epilepsy patients, but further research and studies must investigate if it significantly improves outcomes [64, 66, 67]. 1.1. FUNDAMENTALS OF EPILEPSY 9 Responsive neurostimulation (RNS) does not stimulate on a set schedule but uses seizure detection methods to decide when to send electrical pulses to the brain [68]. As such, efficient and precise implementations of both detection and stimulation are necessary for RNS therapy to be successful, but the benefit of significantly reduced periods of stimulation compared to other regularly stimulating systems advocates for this neurostimulation method [69]. 10 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 1.2 Fundamentals of Wearable Biosignal Recording « Miniaturization of components has enabled systems that are wearable and nearly invisible, so that individuals can move about and interact freely, supported by their personal information domain. » — Steve Mann, 1997 [70] A wearable device, or wearable, is a self-sufficient electronic device that can be worn on the human body in some form. In this thesis wearables are battery-powered devices which can record at least one sensor modality that represents one of the wearer’s biosignals. While wearable technology in a broader sense has existed for some hundred years, wearable elec- tronic computing devices only emerged in the 1970s and 1980s [71]. Since then, wearables have made giant leaps in the reduction of size and the increase of functionality. While the first systems included backpacks containing sizeable electrical equipment, the invention and rise of mobile phones and smartphones have considerably boosted the development of small, consumer-grade wearables like smartwatches. Nowadays, wearables can record many differ- ent kinds of biosignals from the human body by way of a varied array of different kinds of recording principles and sensors. Signals may, for example, represent brain, muscle, cardiac, electrodermal, or thermal activity, as well as the motion of different body parts (Figure 1.3). Electroencephalography (EEG) captures changes in the brain’s electrical activity by elec- trodes placed on the scalp. Likewise, surface-electromyography (EMG) records muscle activity via electrodes placed above the muscle to capture the electric potentials induced by its activity. A common technique to record cardiac activity is electrocardiography (ECG) which, like EEG and EMG, also requires electrodes to be placed on the skin.","What is the primary challenge faced by epilepsy patients during long-term EEG monitoring for seizure detection, and are there alternative methods of seizure monitoring in an outpatient context?",en,"The primary challenge faced by epilepsy patients during long-term EEG monitoring for seizure detection is the need to wear high-density EEG electrode arrays or have electrodes implanted, which can be inconvenient and may affect their daily activities. An alternative method of seizure monitoring in an outpatient context is keeping a seizure diary of manually recorded occurrences of seizures in the patient's daily life. This systematic and long-term documentation is essential for therapeutic decision-making and clinical and pharmacological studies.",The primary challenge is wearing high-density EEG electrode arrays or having electrodes implanted. An alternative method is keeping a seizure diary.
"Although some notable exceptions exist [72–74], the need for electrodes to measure these electrical signals is an important factor in why wearable systems rarely measure them, especially in a long-term context. Electrodes are challenging to apply correctly by oneself, they can be very obtrusive and stigmatizing, and typically only last for a few days until they need to be reapplied, producing additional cost during long-term and ultra-long-term recordings. Furthermore, they are often recorded at high sample rates of at least 250 Hz, producing large amounts of data that need to be stored and transferred. While some studies presented in this thesis also included devices with elec- trodes and wires to record biosignals, the research presented here excludes them for the above reasons. Consumer-grade wearables and similar devices, however, most often record signals with- out the use of electrodes and wires. Thereby, sensors frequently target different aspects of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), with biosignal modalities such as electrodermal activ- ity (EDA), photoplethysmography (PPG)1, and skin temperature (TMP). Moreover, modalities such as accelerometry (ACC) and gyroscopy measure the motion of body parts. Section 2.2 goes into further detail regarding these biosignal modalities. A notable difference between electrographic and wearable biosignal modalities is the variety of the sample rates at which the devices typically record the signals. While brain activity changes occur in milliseconds, changes in the autonomic nervous system happen over seconds to minutes. Thus, sample rates of wearable biosignal recordings, specifically those made with consumer-grade non- electrographic wearables like smartwatches, usually do not exceed frequencies of 100 Hz. 1From Ancient Greek pháos: light; pl¯ethusmós: increasing, enlargement; gráph¯o: to write 1.2. FUNDAMENTALS OF WEARABLE BIOSIGNAL RECORDING 11 Electrocardiography (ECG) Electroencephalography (EEG) Electromyography (EMG) Electrodermal Activity (EDA) Accelerometry (ACC) Skin Temperature (TMP) Photoplethysmography (PPG) Figure 1.3: Overview of biosignal modalities typically recorded with different types of wear- ables. Devices with electrodes and wires record EEG, ECG, and EMG (green). Wearables such as a wristwatch record ACC, EDA, PPG, and TMP (blue). Smartphones commonly also record ACC, among other modalities. In this thesis, the data analyses concerning the design and evaluation of seizure detection methodologies make use of the biosignal modalities ACC, EDA, and blood volume pulse (BVP) as a product of PPG. These modalities were recorded by the wrist-worn wearable (Empatica E4, see Section 3.2.1) employed in the data collection studies relevant to this thesis. While the device also recorded the TMP modality, these data were not included in the analyses presented here, as the effects of thermoregulation in epilepsy are not yet well understood and the quality of the sensor data is questionable (see Section 2.2.4). Furthermore, a different device worn by a small subset of study participants also recorded the electrographic modalities, which were not included here for the above-mentioned disadvantages devices measuring these modalities have. ACC captures any movement the wearer of the device makes with the body part the wear- able is attached to, usually the left or right arm in the case of this wrist-worn device, although it can be worn on the ankles as well. The output of the sensor is a three-dimensional vector com- prising the accelerations in any direction of a Cartesian coordinate system, including earth’s gravitational acceleration. Although ACC sensors are most often also included in modern smartphones, these data were not used in the analyses presented here as the study partici- 12 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION pants were unlikely to carry their phones with them while visiting the epilepsy monitoring unit and being constrained to a hospital bed. EDA data represent changes in the electrical conductance of the skin at the sensor location. While sweat gland activity is the primary origin of these changes, EDA is a general surrogate of ANS activity, and symptoms like piloerection1 may also have an effect on the EDA signal. As such, changes in the signal are typically slow and occur below a frequency of 1 Hz. Nev- ertheless, the sensor relies on constant contact to the skin and will only record zero-values as soon as contact is lost. BVP is a signal produced by filtering and further processing the raw output of a PPG sensor. It is representative of the volume of arterial blood in the tissue where the sensor is located. A robust estimation of the heart rate from this signal is possible for periods of good data quality. However, the BVP signal is highly susceptible to artifacts from motion and external light sources. Thus, in this thesis, the signal was only considered for the analysis of less-severe focal seizures as the signal quality was insufficient during convulsive seizures. For a more detailed description of these three biosignal modalities captured by the Empat- ica E4 wearable and their application in further research, see Section 2.1. 1Colloquialism: “goose bumps” 1.3. FUNDAMENTALS OF SEIZURE DETECTION 13 1.3 Fundamentals of Seizure Detection « Until recently, recorded seizures have been inspected only if the time of their oc- currence was reported [...]. Any unreported seizures were not examined because of the long time required to search the many hours of tape for only a few minutes of relevant data. In order to detect [...] seizures which might go unreported, an electronic circuit was designed to detect and report all electrographic seizure pat- terns. » — Thomas L. Babb et al., 1974 [75] The automatic detection of seizures without the need for manual human labor has been a relevant problem since the beginnings of electrographic epilepsy examinations. Early re- search focused on analog electrical circuits and systems to detect seizures directly from elec- troencephalography signals [75], or simple digital computers implementing basic detection algorithms [76]. At the same time, machine learning methodologies developed and advanced, making use of the steadily rising computational capabilities of digital computers. Nowadays, modern seizure detection methodologies can draw on a vast library of different machine learn- ing techniques. 1.3.1 Types of Machine Learning Machine learning is a field of research concerned with designing methodologies and algo- rithms capable of inferring specific information from unspecific data.","Why are electrodes typically not used in long-term wearable systems to measure electrical signals, as mentioned in this text?",en,"Electrodes are typically not used in long-term wearable systems to measure electrical signals due to several reasons: they can be challenging to apply correctly by oneself, they are often obtrusive and stigmatizing, they usually last only a few days before needing replacement, which can add cost during long-term recordings, they require high sample rates that produce large amounts of data for storage and transfer, and devices with electrodes and wires can be cumbersome. Consumer-grade wearables most often record signals without the use of electrodes, using sensors targeting different aspects of the autonomic nervous system or measuring body motion instead.","Electrodes are rarely used in long-term wearable systems due to challenges in self-application, obtrusiveness, short lifespan, high data storage/transfer requirements, and cost."
"The constructs imple- menting this inference are called models, and the methodologies that govern these models are generally described by three different principles: Supervised Learning: The input to the machine learning model is labeled data, that is, each data sample is given a specific description in relation to the problem at hand. For ex- ample, in seizure detection the simplest categorization would be a binary labeling of whether data samples are concurrent with a seizure or not. This data labeling is often gained from a gold standard knowledge source, for example, marked by epilepsy clini- cians reviewing the video-electroencephalography data recorded at the epilepsy moni- toring unit. The labeled data are used to “train” the machine learning model. The general goal is to be able to use this trained model to automatically derive labels for new, unla- beled data [77]. Unsupervised Learning: Data are not labeled by some external mechanism, such that ma- chine learning methodologies are tasked with automatically finding structures or pat- terns in the data. A common type of unsupervised modeling are clustering algorithms, which find data samples that are similar to each other by some metric. Optimally, these clusters or patterns can then be linked to certain aspects of the problem at hand, and thereby classify the data. Semi-supervised learning is a hybrid type wherein only a small subset of data is labeled by hand, increasing the performance of the classification at the expense of some human overhead. With respect to seizure detection, an unsupervised detection model might detect anomalies where some data periods are substantially dif- ferent from others, corresponding to times when a seizure occurred [78–80]. 14 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION Reinforcement Learning: The machine learning algorithm gets direct feedback from the space it operates in with regard to its performance, being either rewarded or penalized. The algorithm can adjust its functionality in accordance, with the goal of maximizing rewards over time. Feedback can be given automatically by some outcome metric, or pro- vided manually by a user. This often requires many cycles of the classification-reward mechanic and may be constrained by time and space requirements in a real-world appli- cation. A possible application of reinforcement learning in the field of epileptic seizure detection may implement a pre-trained supervised detection model which is further ca- pable of receiving feedback from the patient whenever a seizure was detected, saying it was either a true seizure or a false detection, thus improving its performance over time [81, 82]. In the data analysis included here, only supervised machine learning is considered. While other methodologies would certainly be viable as well, the goal of the work that formed the ba- sis of this thesis was to use simple supervised models that are easily reproducible, can achieve good performance on small data sets, and can be applied to data in real time. 1.3.2 Supervised Machine Learning Models In supervised learning, algorithms trained with labeled data must generalize to previously unseen data. This poses a trade-off between bias and variance concerning the ability of a model to predict the correct output for some arbitrary input data. A model with a high bias, for example, would not properly represent the structure of the data because it makes certain incorrect assumptions about the complexity of the data, or lack thereof. It would be under- fitted and thus miss some events, regarding them as unimportant because they do not fit into the structure of the model. Conversely, a high variance would cause a model to map to training data too well and regard noise as relevant information. It would be over-fitted and drastically change its output even with only minor changes in the training data. One of the goals of supervised machine learning models is to find a balance between these two aspects. Other factors are the amount, imbalance, dimensionality, and heterogeneity of training data [77, 83]. There are a multitude of different types of supervised machine learning models, and each type is further divided into different subtypes and implementations. Furthermore, there are some meta-methodologies concerned with improving predictive performance by creating en- sembles of individual models. A detailed description of each of the supervised machine learn- ing methodologies is beyond the scope of this introduction, but the following will give a brief overview of some major types of algorithms. See relevant introductory literature for more in-depth descriptions of these machine learning techniques [77, 84–86]. Decision Trees: A decision tree is a machine learning model that consists of several chained binary decisions that can be arranged in a tree-like structure. Each decision node splits according to a logic applied to an input variable, and each leaf node represents a possible outcome. In its absolute simplest form, a decision tree has only one node with two leafs, and the output is determined by the value of a single input variable [87]. Support Vector Machines: This type of methodology maps input data into a higher-dimen- sional space such that the distances between data points of differing output classes are maximized. The trained mapping is then applied to the unlabeled test data and the 1.3. FUNDAMENTALS OF SEIZURE DETECTION 15 prediction is made corresponding to the side of the decision gap the mapped sample falls on [88]. Nearest Neighbor: This algorithm compares data samples by some distance metric and se- lects a class according to the training samples nearest to the input sample. Like most supervised classifiers, it relies on sensible feature engineering and parameter tuning to achieve good performances. Dimensionality reduction is another preprocessing step that is often necessary for this type of learning, as high-dimensional data tend to require exponentially more training data to produce a robust classifier [89]. Naive Bayes: While the previous algorithms are deterministic in nature, Bayesian networks are probabilistic learners. Naive Bayes classifiers, a simple form of Bayesian networks, assume that the input variables are strongly independent and uses maximum likelihood estimation to infer the probabilities of a data sample to be of a certain class. They are theoretically not applicable if the independence assumption does not hold, although they have been used effectively regardless of that limitation [90].","What are the three principles that govern machine learning models, and how is data labeling obtained in supervised learning?",en,"Les trois principes qui gouvernent les modèles de machine apprentissage sont la Supervision, l'Apprentissage Non-Supervisé et l'Apprentissage Mixte (Semi-supervisé). Dans le cadre de la supervision, les données d'entrée du modèle sont des données étiquetées, c'est-à-dire que chaque échantillon de données est marqué d'une description spécifique en relation avec le problème considéré. Par exemple, pour la détection d'accès epileptiques, un exemple le plus simple serait une étiquetage binaire indiquant si les échantillons de données sont ou non concomitants à un accès épileptique. Cette étiquetage des données est souvent obtenue auprès d'une source de connaissances or, par exemple, en marquant les données vidéo-électroencéphalographie auprès des cliniciens épileptiques ayant évalué les données enregistrées dans l'unité de surveillance de l'épilepsie. Ces données étiquetées sont utilisées pour ""former"" le modèle de machine apprentissage. Le but est de pouvoir utiliser ce modèle formé pour automatiquement déterminer les étiquettes des nouvelles données non-étiquetées.","The three principles governing machine learning models are Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Semi-supervised Learning. In Supervised Learning, data is labeled by an external source, often gained from experts such as epilepsy clinicians."
"Artificial Neural Networks: Based in principle on biological neural networks, these mod- els are a collection of artificial neurons and connections, or more abstractly nodes and edges. This network propagates a high-dimensional input to a low-dimensional output, through a series of weighted functions. They typically implement back-propagation to gradually adjust weights over multiple cycles, representing the learning ability of the network. These models require a large amount of raw input data and are difficult to interpret in detail [91, 92]. In addition to these individual types of supervised machine learning, techniques to compile and employ multiple instances of these classifiers in a collection have been developed. While there are a few different methodologies of creating these ensembles of learners, the two most prominent and widely used are briefly described here: Bagging: Bootstrap aggregation, also called bagging, is a method of independently training multiple individual classifiers with randomly sampled data from the training data set in parallel. During testing, new data are then given to all of these sub-learners and a major- ity vote decides on the output classification of the whole ensemble. This methodology may mitigate over-fitting that would occur if only a single instance of the individual learner was used, and thus will typically outperform them. It does however not help with under-fitting as a high bias in each individual model still results in a high output bias. The method of aggregating specifically decision tree models in this way is called random forest [93, 94]. Gradient Boosting: Contrary to bagging, gradient boosting trains multiple specifically weak learners that are only slightly better than chance, and does so iteratively and not in par- allel. The output of the whole ensemble is described as a weighted sum of the individual learners’ outputs. For each new learner that gets added to the ensemble the training samples are also weighted proportional to their error in the previous iteration by some loss function, such that new learners target training samples with worse performance. In each iteration multiple potential new learners are trained, and the one with the least amount of total weighted error is chosen to be added to the ensemble [95, 96]. 16 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION In the main analysis work compiled in this thesis gradient boosted decision trees (GBT) models are employed as the classification model to implement the binary detection of epileptic seizures. 1.3.3 Seizure Detection Pipeline Aside from the classification model itself, supervised seizure detection requires a number of different data analysis steps, which can be integrated into a complete seizure detection pipeline from raw input data to classification labels [84, 97, 98]. Figure 1.4a gives an overview of how this pipeline was designed and implemented in the work presented here. Raw data are first prepared through various different preprocessing steps before features are extracted in the next step. The feature vectors are then used to optimize and train the model, and other, previ- ously unseen test data are then processed by the same pipeline to be classified by the created model. Lastly, the model performance is evaluated by comparing the classifications to the true labels. The following describes the sequence of analysis steps in more detail: Data Preparation: Raw sensor data typically require some form of preprocessing before it can be used for further analysis. The amount and type of processing steps involved depend on the format and quality of the raw data and the purpose of the analysis. They can range from trivial operations like de-duplication or sorting, over data quality checks and synchronization of time stamps, to modifying processes like signal filtering. Feature Extraction: Preprocessed sensor data can potentially be used directly, as is for in- stance done in artificial neural network models. In typical supervised learning applica- tions, however, it is usually further processed into a number of different features, that is, calculated values representing different aspects and properties of the raw data. These features are most often calculated from sections of data instead of single samples, and thus data are first segmented before features are extracted. These data “windows” have a certain defined length and interval, both counted in number of samples, which can potentially result in overlap. The types of features themselves are highly dependent on the modality of the data and the purpose of the data analysis. Features are typically grouped as time domain and frequency domain features, according to the nature of the calculation with respect to the time series data. Selection of Training and Test Data: Training data for seizure detection models are typi- cally selected from the peri-ictal data of a number of seizures of a specific type, either from a single study participant or multiple different ones. In order to properly evalu- ate a trained detection model, the test data given to the final model for classification and evaluation need to be completely separate from the data the model was trained with. Accordingly, the data set is split into training and test data sets before creating the model, such that the trained model has never seen any of the data in the test set. In seizure detection, this is optimally done by selecting the test data from a different patient cohort than the training data, or at least selecting it from other patients in the same cohort, in the case of generic model evaluation. For individualized models, the test data would comprise the complete rest of the data for a particular participant, that was not selected for the training process, whereby the training data would comprise a specific set of seizures’ peri-ictal data. 1.3.",What are the two most common methods for creating ensembles of learners in Artificial Neural Networks and how do they differ from each other? (Bagging vs Other Methodologies),en,"Les deux méthodes les plus couramment utilisées pour créer des ensembles de learning dans les réseaux neuronaux artificiels sont Bagging et Boosting. Le Bagging, ou Bootstrap Aggregation, est une méthode consistant à entraîner plusieurs apprenants individuels avec un échantillon aléatoire des données d'entraînement en parallèle. Lors de la phase de test, les nouvelles données sont alors transmises à tous ces apprenants et le vote majoritaire décide de l'output de classement de l'ensemble entier. Cette méthodologie peut atténuer l'overfitting qui serait produit si seul un exemple d'apprenant individuel était utilisé, ce qui provoque souvent une performance supérieure. Cependant, elle ne peut pas aider à surmonter le sous-entraînement car un biais élevé dans chaque modèle individuel conduira toujours à une sortie importante.

Le Boosting est une autre méthode d'amélioration de la performance des apprenants en utilisant progressivement plusieurs apprenants en les combinant successivement, avec une distribution pondérée des données de formation sur chaque apprenant. Ainsi, chaque apprenant est entraîné pour résoudre les erreurs précédentes des apprenants précédents. Cette méthode s'avère particulièrement efficace pour améliorer le sous-entraînement et peut donc aider à surmonter les problèmes de sous-entraînement, contrairement au Bagging. Cependant, elle est plus complexe à implémenter que la méthode de Bagging.","The two most common methods for creating ensembles in Artificial Neural Networks are Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation) and other methodologies. Bagging trains multiple individual classifiers with randomly sampled data from the training set, then uses a majority vote to decide output classification. Other methods may differ in their approach, but Bagging stands out for its ability to mitigate overfitting and improve performance compared to single instances of individual learners."

This step is repeated with each possible parameter set, finding the optimal parameters to use in the final model. 18 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION Model Creation and Optimization: The process of creating a detection model with the GBT algorithm includes a parameter optimization step before training the final model with data. Figure 1.4b illustrates a more detailed overview of the parameter optimization process as it was implemented in the seizure detection pipeline employed here. Param- eter optimization is carried out as follows: 1. For each model parameter that is to be optimized, a range of potential values is selected; 2. For each unique combination of parameter values, a k-fold cross-validation is per- formed with the input training data, split into training and validation sets and with the folds corresponding to, for example, the number of unique participants (leave- one-participant-out) or the number of seizures (leave-one-seizure-out); 3. The parameter combination that achieves the best mean performance with respect to the cross-validation is chosen for the final model; 4. The final model is trained with the whole training set. Classification and Performance Evaluation: The test data are processed by the model re- sulting in a series of binary classifications for each of the feature vectors in the test set, either detecting an event or not. To evaluate these results, they are compared to the corresponding ground truth labels, and certain scoring metrics are calculated indicating the performance of the model on this out-of-sample test data. In seizure detection this is typically done by deriving ground truth and detection events from the sample-wise labels and checking for overlaps between those events, such that an overlap between a ground truth and prediction event would constitute a true positive, a predicted event without a corresponding event in the ground truth would count as a false positive, and a false negative in the reverse case. From these direct confusion matrix scores, other met- rics like the sensitivity and false alarm rate are derived. These metrics can then be used to compare the performances of different methodologies, even across studies, although discrepancies between studies in terms of study cohorts, the size of the data sets, and data pre- and postprocessing need to be kept in mind. 1.4. MOTIVATION 19 1.4 Motivation « Why do we need wearable devices in epilepsy? Seizure diaries derived from seizures reported by patients and caregivers are unreliable, yet they constitute the input for therapeutic decisions in clinical practice and for the outcomes in drug trials. An objective quantification of seizure burden could improve clinical decision-making and the quality of the drug trials. » — Sándor Beniczky et al., 2020 [99] Broadly, the goals and use cases of automatic seizure detection are twofold: Providing an alarm system or generating a seizure diary. In this thesis, the feasibility of automatically generating a seizure diary by way of seizure detection with wearable data is investigated. Nevertheless, patients who suffer from seizures that could be dangerous or life-threatening, that is, being at risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, need seizure alarms. Especially during the night or if the patient is alone, an alarm could automatically notify caregivers or emergency services to provide help. As such, the performance requirements for seizure alarm systems are high, necessitating short latencies from seizure onset to alarm. Some research on automated seizure alarm systems has used wearable systems, and some products on the market already offer this functionality, albeit only under specific conditions and for convulsive seizures. Furthermore, while several studies have employed at-home video-electroencephalography systems similar to those used in epilepsy monitoring units [56, 100, 101], several fundamental challenges currently limit their feasibility and thus their adoption in general clinical practice. They are limited to a few days of recording time, are impractical to set up, present considerable overhead concerning integration with in-hospital services, and pose regulatory challenges to overcome [100]. This thesis investigates seizure detection in automated seizure diaries for ultra-long-term epilepsy monitoring with wearables. The primary methodology for monitoring epilepsy and seizures in an ambulatory setting in clinical use is record-keeping in manual seizure diaries (Section 1.1.3). Manual seizure diaries, however, are highly unreliable [54, 102] (Figure 1.5). Es- timates show that patients typically self-report less than 50 % of seizures, especially concern- ing seizures occurring during sleep [59, 102]. Wearable devices could fill this gap in ultra-long- term epilepsy monitoring, providing relevant biosignals that enable the automated detection of epileptic seizures. To explore the feasibility of automated seizure diaries, biosignal data from wearable de- vices were collected from patients with epilepsy and several evaluations of methodologies were done in the context of this thesis. The relevant data collection studies and investiga- tions were conducted within the scope of the European Union collaborative research project Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse - Central Nervous System1.","What is the main process described in the given diagram for implementing seizure detection, and what are the subsequent steps following model creation?",en,"The main process described in the diagram for implementing seizure detection is as follows:

1. Raw Data Pre-Processing: This involves cleaning and preparing the raw data for further analysis.
2. Feature Extraction: This step involves extracting meaningful features from the pre-processed data that can be used to train the model.
3. Model Creation: A classification model is created using these extracted features.
4. Optimization - Training: The newly created model is trained on a portion of the data (Training Data).
5. K-fold Cross-Validation: The performance of the model with different parameter combinations is gauged by splitting the training data into multiple training and validation set pairs, and performing k-fold cross-validation. This helps find the optimal parameters for the final model.
6. Optimization - Parameter Combination: The process of iteration over parameter combinations is repeated until an optimal parameter combination is found.
7. Training Sets Validation Sets: The training data is split into training sets and validation sets, which are used in the optimization process.
8. Test Data: Once the model is optimized, it is applied to a separate set of data (Test Data) to discover events (that is, detect seizures).
9. De-Duplication - Synchronization - Data Validation - Segmentation - Feature Calculation: These steps are not explicitly shown in the diagram but are likely part of the pre-processing and post-processing stages, where data is cleaned, synced, validated, segmented, and additional features may be calculated if necessary.
10. Optimal Parameter Combination: The final model is trained using the optimal parameter combination found during optimization.

Following model creation, the performance of the model can be evaluated and potentially further optimized based on the results obtained from the test data.","The main process for seizure detection is the pipeline that pre-processes raw data, extracts features, creates a classification model, evaluates it, and applies it to detect seizures. Following model creation, subsequent steps include finding the optimal parameter combination through k-fold cross-validation and using this optimized model on test data."

KEY CONTRIBUTIONS AND OUTLINE 21 1.5 Key Contributions and Outline This thesis provides a framework for several published articles on seizure detection with wear- able devices. It focuses on detecting motor-onset seizures using multimodal data from a wrist- worn, smartwatch-like wearable. After this introduction, the thesis comprises four parts. The second chapter explores relevant research in epilepsy monitoring with wearables. The subse- quent three chapters highlight five publications with substantial contributions to this subject: Methods and Study Design: This chapter describes the data collection study procedures. Bruno and Böttcher et al. (2021) [103] compiled multiple studies with wearable devices in epilepsy monitoring conducted by an international group of epilepsy researchers. In particular, this part emphasizes the procedures of the in-patient study at the epilepsy monitoring units of the University Medical Center Freiburg and the King’s College Hos- pital London, which provided the data set used in most of the other work presented in this thesis. Detection of Major Convulsive Seizures: The detection of convulsive seizures, such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, is the first step to a functioning seizure detection system, as they are generally considered the most straightforward to detect among the different seizure types, particularly with data from non-EEG wearable devices. Böttcher et al. (2021) [104] describe, implement, and eval- uate a seizure detection pipeline for the supervised classification of these convulsive seizures. Bruno and Böttcher et al. (2020) [105] outline a possible application of tonic- clonic seizure detection, which explores the feasibility of detecting post-ictal immobil- ity and unconsciousness, a major sudden unexpected death in epilepsy risk factor, by wearable biosignal data. Detection of Focal Onset Seizures: While detecting major convulsive seizures was possible with robust performances, focal seizures with less convulsive motor onsets often mani- fest in more moderate or arbitrary ways. Böttcher et al. (2019) [106] explore the hetero- geneous manifestations of focal motor seizures. Furthermore, Böttcher et al. (2022) [107] modify the existing seizure detection pipeline and evaluate it on focal motor seizures, highlighting differences between individually trained models and inter-participant de- tectors. Finally, the last chapter concludes with a brief discussion of the presented research and an outlook of possible paths to further advance the field, both in general seizure detection research in controlled in-patient conditions and concerning ambulatory contexts. For each of the five major publications included in this thesis, a more detailed listing of own contributions is given at the start of the corresponding section.

RELATED WORK S eizure detection with wearables has been a research topic for over 10 years now, and as wearable technology develops with its increased use in society and popular culture, it is becoming more and more relevant for epilepsy as well. After the previous chapter introduced the general topic of this thesis and important fundamentals, this chapter dives deeper into the state-of-the-art of some related fields of research. Monitoring epilepsy patients is a necessary clinical tool not only to diagnose and treat individuals, but also to develop new avenues of treatment (Section 2.1).","What are the key contributions of the thesis discussed in this text, and how does it focus on detecting motor-onset seizures using multimodal data from a wrist-worn, smartwatch-like wearable?",en,"The key contributions of the thesis, as discussed in the text, revolve around providing a framework for several published articles on seizure detection with wearable devices. The focus of this thesis is on detecting motor-onset seizures using multimodal data from a wrist-worn, smartwatch-like wearable device. This means that the data collected is not limited to one type (modal), but rather combines various types (multimodal) for more accurate and comprehensive seizure detection. The thesis outlines four parts: an exploration of relevant research in epilepsy monitoring with wearables, followed by five publications that have significant contributions to this subject. The methods and study design chapter describes the data collection procedures for a specific in-patient study at the University Medical Center Freiburg and King's College Hospital London, which provided the dataset used in this thesis.","The thesis focuses on detecting motor-onset seizures using multimodal data from a wrist-worn, smartwatch-like wearable.

"While some possibil- ities exist to monitor patients at home with video or video-electroencephalography systems, they are typically short-term, cumbersome, and intrusive. Wearables on the other hand are much less burdensome, but still lack in seizure detection performance. Further, patients’ and caregivers’ needs should be taken into account when developing wearable seizure monitoring technologies. The cornerstone of wearable monitoring are biosignal sensors, technology that has existed and has been developed for much longer than wearable epilepsy monitoring itself (Section 2.2). A multitude of different biosignal modalities are available in modern sensor systems, each with their own opportunities and pitfalls. Here, relevant sensor technology in the context of epilepsy monitoring is introduced and discussed. Seizure detection with wearables, while still a relatively new field of research, has already undergone meaningful development since its inception (Section 2.3). Especially with regard to convulsive motor seizures, detection is already at a stage allowing for first prospective am- bulatory clinical trials, a major step towards widespread adoption of the technology in clinical routine. However, the detection of other less severe or non-motor seizures is still in its infancy, and new promising methodologies are being developed every year [108–110]. Seizure prediction and forecasting is a related yet different field of research, aiming to predict seizures before they occur, or at least give estimates of seizure likelihood for some timeframe (Section 2.4). Even further removed, but in some key ways still comparable, is the monitoring of other conditions similar to epilepsy. Among these are neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease, but also other types of seizures that are not epileptic in nature (Section 2.5). 2.1.

In this section the advancements and state-of-the-art in epilepsy monitoring are highlighted. Wearable devices and their applications have gone through extensive development and re- search in the past, especially in the last 10-20 years. Not only has their size decreased and computing power increased substantially, but the sensor technology integrated into the de- vices has improved as well [111, 112]. In the same way, usage of wearable devices in epilepsy research has picked up substantially in the past 10 years. Figure 2.1 shows this development over the past 20 years on the basis of publication frequency, as indexed on PubMed. Wear- ables in healthcare monitoring have the potential to provide real-time, continuous, and ultra- long-term biosignal data on a multitude of aspects of the human body [111]. A wide-spread adoption of wearable devices in public healthcare systems, however, is still hindered by factors such as security and privacy [112], integration into electronic health records [113], and engi- neering challenges like power supply and communication abilities [111, 114]. Yet, wearables are featured in a large variety of state-of-the-art healthcare research, from classic use cases like cardiology [115], over sophisticated microfluidic sensing platforms [111], to applications in psychophysiology [116]. 2.1.1 Monitoring of Patients with Epilepsy In the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy, short- and long-term monitoring in the in-patient as well as the out-patient setting are essential [102]. Not only is monitoring necessary to separate epilepsy from non-epileptic syndromes like psychogenic non-epileptic seizures [117], but also to improve the management of already diagnosed epilepsy [118]. Another important indication for admission to a monitoring unit is presurgical evaluation, that is, determining if a patient is a candidate for a resective brain surgery [61]. However, the informational yield of in-hospital video-electroencephalography (vEEG) monitoring is reduced significantly after 26 CHAPTER 2. RELATED WORK only a few days [50], such that monitoring outside the hospital environment in an ambulatory setting is necessary. VEEG monitoring at home has been used in several studies to varying but generally posi- tive results [56, 100]. While hospital conditions ensure good quality recordings and the highest chances of capturing seizure events, at-home monitoring is overall more accepted by patients and incurs less cost [56], making it more suitable as a first step in managing an individual’s epilepsy. Nevertheless, ambulatory vEEG monitoring is limited to the patient’s home, requir- ing wearable devices for continuous monitoring, for example, while travelling [100]. Implantable sub-scalp electroencephalography (EEG) devices are in development, poten- tially providing robust recordings of ultra-long-term ambulatory EEG [119]. Adoption of these devices may substantially change the landscape of ambulatory epilepsy monitoring. Further- more, smartphones can serve as an ad hoc solution to provide video monitoring of seizures outside of dedicated video monitoring units [120]. Data from ambulatory epilepsy monitor- ing with wearable devices may also contribute to advances in seizure forecasting and pre- diction [60]. Multiple studies have investigated the feasibility of wearable non-EEG devices for epilepsy monitoring and seizure detection out of the hospital, but assessment without an established gold standard is still problematic [110, 121–123]. 2.1.2 Experiences and Needs of Patients While wearable devices are much less intrusive and burdensome than vEEG systems, there are still a variety of aspects to consider when it comes to their acceptability and adoption among patients with epilepsy [124]. A need to balance costs and benefits arises for patients with re- spect to wearing devices, with potential costs being higher stigma and increased anxiety, and perceived benefits being improved safety and feedback on their condition [125]. Additionally, patients are now in charge of facilitating effective data recordings, and devices and systems need to account for the large heterogeneity in technology management skills of patients [126]. Other important factors to consider are visibility, wear comfort, removability, technical sup- port, and knowledge or at least perception of the effectiveness of the wearable [72]. In one study the perceived performance of the wearable device, that is, the number of missed seizures or false alarms, was even the main reason for participants to stop using the device, with the least important factor being the design of the device [127].","What are the current challenges and advancements in the development of wearable technologies for seizure monitoring, taking into account both the performance of such systems and the needs of patients and caregivers?",en,"The current challenges and advancements in the development of wearable technologies for seizure monitoring are multifaceted. On one hand, these devices need to improve their seizure detection performance, particularly for non-motor or less severe seizures, which are still at an early stage of development (Section 2.3). On the other hand, it's crucial to consider the needs of both patients and caregivers during the design process. While wearables are generally less burdensome than video or video-electroencephalography systems, they should ideally be as unobtrusive and user-friendly as possible. One promising area is the use of biosignal sensors in these devices (Section 2.2), but more research and development are needed to fully realize their potential for effective seizure detection and prediction. [108–110] offer some insight into emerging methodologies in this field.","Current challenges are improving non-motor seizure detection and forecasting in wearable tech. Advancements include convulsive motor seizure detection reaching a stage for ambulatory clinical trials, and continuous development of new methodologies."
"However, wearables that utilize electrodes, cables, patches, and similar parts can substantially change the self-awareness of patients with epilepsy and can lead to higher perceived stigma, with the devices further high- lighting their condition [128]. The monetary cost of a wearable device is also a potential barrier and should not be disregarded when considering the impact on patients [129]. These experiences and views of patients result in a number of requirements for wearable devices. Fundamentally, the clinician’s need for a robust seizure detection device translates to patients’ and caregivers’ needs for improved safety, independence, and management of the epilepsy [130]. They must be able to trust a given device, that is, be able to depend on it performing without fail, a need which is amplified when considering pediatric patients and their parental caregivers [131, 132]. 2.2. BIOSIGNAL MODALITIES 27 2.2 Biosignal Modalities B C A Figure 2.2: Biosignal modalities and associated sensors.

(c) Electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor dry electrodes built into the wrist strap of the Empatica E4 device; Ex- ample of raw EDA data. This section highlights some of the biosignal modalities that can be used for monitoring epilepsy and seizures, and outlines the working principles of the respective sensors. Specifi- cally, information on the four main biosignal modalities captured by the Empatica E4 device is compiled (see also Section 3.2.1). Figure 2.2 gives a brief overview of some of these modali- ties. Movement is registered by ACC sensors and is a major source of information regarding epileptic seizures with motor components [134]. EDA is an important surrogate for autonomic nervous system activity [135]. Cardiovascular activity during seizures can be measured by PPG sensors [136]. Finally, while not specifically used in the analyses presented here, other relevant biosignals include the skin temperature (TMP) [137] and electrographic modalities like electromyography (EMG). 2.2.1 Movement ACC sensors in the form of microelectromechanical systems have been some of the most ubiquitously used sensors in smart technology and nowadays are a regular part of wearables, smartphones, and other such devices [138]. The accelerometer captures activity induced by the sensor’s motion or displacement, typically by variable capacitive measurement (although piezoresistive ACC sensors also exist), whereby a freely movable comb-like proof mass swings between fixed counterparts [139]. This structure effectively combines into capacitors with varying distances between plates, and thus the capacitance is measurable in an analog elec- 28 CHAPTER 2. RELATED WORK trical circuit. If the sensor begins to move in the direction of its free axis, inertia compels the proof mass to lag behind the fixed part of the sensor, which is measurable as a change of capacitance. To achieve three-axis accelerometers, either three such sensors are combined in one package, one in every direction in three-dimensional space, or in more complex chips a single proof mass is used with a series of springs providing the necessary degrees of free- dom [140]. An analog-to-digital converter then translates the analog signals from each sensor to digital outputs, and a controller interprets them as amplitudes in the unit of g, or m/s2. Important to note is that, as the name suggests, these devices only capture the acceleration of a movement. Thus, an ACC sensor moving at a constant speed will show a constant signal. This signal includes the earth’s gravitational acceleration of ∼9.81 m/s2 or 1 g, which a filter may later isolate from the linear movements in the sensor output, producing an estimate of orientation [141]. Furthermore, ACC sensors for human activity recognition typically employ sampling frequencies of 25 Hz and above [97], capturing typical human motions and epileptic movement patterns, both of which generally don’t exceed frequencies of 10 Hz [142, 143]. Accelerometers are generally robust against measurement artifacts. Fundamentally, any movement large enough to cause a change in the analog capacitance could be measured, and there are no external, physical, or other reasons for the sensor to produce a relevant change in the signal if there was no movement, provided that it is correctly placed on the body. The most important constraint of the ACC sensor system is the analog-to-digital conversion, which places a minimum and maximum range and sensitivity on the output signal [144]. Controller instructions can sometimes change these parameters to be more or less sensitive towards smaller movements. For example, a sensor range of ±2 g means that the output signal can be at most two times the earth’s gravitational acceleration. For movements of more considerable acceleration, as would be expected in clonic movements of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, the output signal will be saturated, that is, capped at the value of ±2 g. Generally, with regard to epileptic seizures, ACC signals can show very heterogeneous patterns, depending on the seizure type and specific semiologies during the seizure. Figure 2.3 shows sample ACC recordings of three different seizures with movement components. Con- vulsive tonic-clonic seizures produce high-amplitude and high-frequency variations in the ACC signal, that can easily saturate the sensor range. Tonic movements of focal motor seizures display as changes in the gravitational component of the signal with overlaid low-amplitude tremors visible in the linear component. Myoclonic jerks can sometimes be visible in the ACC trace as small signal spikes, but only if no other movements are occurring at the same time, and they are usually indistinguishable from other random short movements. Besides accelerometers, specialized in capturing linear translation, gyroscopy (GYR) sen- sors can measure rotation more accurately. In many cases, these two sensors are used in conjunction, applying sensor fusion to better estimate the device’s position and angle [145]. An inertial measurement unit combines both ACC and GYR sensors, sometimes also including a magnetometer [146]. 2.2.2 Electrodermal Activity With increasing body or skin temperature, the sweat gland activity increases, and sweat pro- duction changes the skin’s electric properties like its conductance, which EDA recordings can capture [148].","What are the key requirements for a wearable device designed to assist patients with epilepsy, particularly considering factors such as patient trust, safety, independence, monetary cost, and potential impact on self-awareness and perceived stigma?",en,"A wearable device designed for patients with epilepsy should meet several requirements to ensure safety, independence, and trustworthiness, while also addressing concerns about monetary cost and potential impact on self-awareness and perceived stigma. Key requirements include:

1. Robust seizure detection capabilities: The primary objective is to assist in detecting seizures accurately and reliably. This capability is essential for both patients and their caregivers, especially pediatric patients.
2. Improved safety: Wearable devices should contribute positively to the safety of users by providing timely alerts about potential seizures or seizure-related risks.
3. Enhanced independence: The device should enable patients with epilepsy to live more independently, by providing them with vital information that allows them to make informed decisions and manage their condition better.
4. Trustworthiness: Users must be able to depend on the device's performance without fail, as any malfunction could potentially have severe consequences. This requirement is amplified in pediatric patients and their parental caregivers.
5. Addressing monetary cost concerns: The financial burden of a wearable device should not be overlooked when considering its impact on patients, as the cost may present a barrier for some individuals.
6. Minimizing self-awareness and perceived stigma: Wearables that utilize electrodes, cables, patches, or similar parts can significantly change the self-awareness of epilepsy patients and potentially contribute to higher perceived stigma. The design should take this into account to ensure the devices do not further highlight or exacerbate these issues.","A wearable device for epilepsy patients should be reliable, safe, affordable, and non-stigmatizing. It should enhance safety, independence, and management of the condition, while ensuring users can trust its performance, especially pediatric patients and their caregivers."
"Besides thermoregulatory processes, other sympathetic nervous system responses like piloerection or psychophysiological arousal may also induce changes in the 2.2.

EDA signal [149, 150]. The literature describes two components that contribute to measurable changes in EDA: The fast galvanic skin responses, also called phasic responses, occur in an order of 0.5 to 5 seconds, while the tonic component develops as changes in the EDA level over multiple minutes [135, 151]. These changes in EDA have also been linked to epileptic seizures, predominantly showing as tonic increases in the post-ictal phase [42, 43, 152, 153]. Sensors typically record EDA using dry electrodes, which do not necessarily need to be adhesive, as long as they have continuous contact with the skin [154]. For instance, some de- vices, integrate electrodes into a bracelet or the device housing itself. The sensor can record the biosignal in two different methods: The passive endosomatic method, measuring the electrical properties of the body without an external electrical source, relying only on changes in elec- trical energy originating from the skin; And the active exosomatic method, using an external electrical current source to measure the electrophysical properties of the skin directly [155]. While sensors rarely use the former method, the latter is the most prevalent and is further di- vided into sensor systems with direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC) sources [155]. Depending on the internal circuitry used in the sensor, either the skin conductance or resis- tance is measured in a constant voltage or a constant current system, respectively, if supplied by a DC source. Likewise, the skin admittance or impedance are measured with the use of an AC source. In all cases, the resulting current through the skin is minuscule [156]. The devices in the studies presented here only employ sensors using the exosomatic AC method. 30 CHAPTER 2. RELATED WORK EDA signals are commonly recorded at sample rates of above 1 Hz, while the relevant frequency range of EDA information in the signal is below 1 Hz for both the phasic and tonic activities [157]. Low-pass or band-pass filters can filter typical sensor noise on the signal in the range of >1 Hz. Connection loss of the electrodes to the skin due to, for example, body motion often causes artifacts in the EDA signal [158]. In these cases, the output signal will show a sharp decrease or increase within just a few samples or fall to a minimum/zero-line value altogether. Simple thresholding or an analysis of the rate of amplitude change can detect these kinds of artifacts [159]. 2.2.3 Photoplethysmography PPG is an optical measurement method to determine changes in volume in the blood flow of a specific body part [160]. The recorded PPG signal is thus sometimes also called BVP. There are two types of PPG sensors: Transmissive mode PPG measures the amount of light arriving at the other side of the body part when shining light through the body, and reflective mode PPG which measures the amount of light reflected when shining it through the skin [136]. Trans- missive mode is thereby constrained to body parts thin enough for light to shine through them, and clinical settings commonly use them in the form of pulse oximeters applied to a person’s finger, not only measuring the change in blood volume but also the oxygen saturation [161]. Reflective mode is more frequently used in ambulatory and wearable contexts, as it can be applied anywhere on the body, such as on the wrist or upper arm. In reflective PPG measurements, a light-emitting diode (LED) shines light toward the skin, and a photoelectric sensor records the amount of reflected light, modulated by the different light absorption rates of the tissue at the recording location [162] and the blood during a typical pulse wave cycle [163]. While green light has a lesser optical penetration depth than red and infrared light [164], shorter light wavelengths also have a higher absorption coefficient in blood [165], resulting in a higher signal-to-noise ratio with respect to monitoring blood volume in tissue. Thus, green LEDs are generally considered a better alternative to red ones for PPG sensors, which has been confirmed in comparative studies [166, 167]. Additionally, PPG sensors can measure changes in blood oxygen saturation by combining green, red, and infrared light [160, 168, 169]. The shape of a clean PPG signal is closely related to the blood pulse wave of the human body and can vary depending on the specific measurement site [170]. Generally, a heartbeat is visible through the signal’s rising edge, culminating in the systolic peak, followed by a decline towards the dicrotic notch and diastolic peak, and ending in a further decline towards a baseline before the next pulse starts [171]. Figure 2.4 shows the BVP signal in detail. The heart rate (HR) is thereby directly and accurately derivable from the peak to peak intervals between single systolic peaks. Depending on the circumstances and properties of the sensor, a lower-frequency component attributed to the breathing frequency of the subject may also modulate the raw signal [172]. Some sensors and devices, however, may immediately filter out this signal component and not include it in the output data.","What are the different types of epileptic seizures shown in the given figure, and how can they be distinguished using three-axis acceleration (ACC) signals recorded by a sensor with a range of ±2 g?",en,"The figure shows three different types of epileptic seizures:
1. Convulsive focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure: This is characterized by a sudden increase in acceleration onset (green vertical line), followed by a prolonged period of high amplitude accelerations (clonic phase) with some brief intervals of lower amplitudes (tonic phase).
2. Focal seizure (FS) with impaired awareness, starting with tonic and evolving to clonic arm movements: This type begins with a sudden increase in acceleration at onset (green vertical line), followed by a period of high amplitude tonic-like accelerations, which then transition into clonic-like movements.
3. FS with impaired awareness, with marked myoclonus at seizure onset, and clonic movements throughout: This type displays a sudden increase in acceleration at onset (green vertical line), followed by a period of high amplitude myoclonic-like jerks, which then progress into continuous clonic movements.
The differentiation between these types can be achieved using three-axis acceleration signals recorded by a sensor with a range of ±2 g, as each seizure type shows distinct patterns of accelerations in terms of onset, amplitude, and duration.","The figure shows three types of epileptic seizures: Convulsive focal to bilateral tonic-clonic, Focal tonic and clonic with impaired awareness, and Focal myoclonic and clonic with impaired awareness. These can be distinguished using ACC signals by observing the pattern and intensity of arm movements (tonic and clonic) or myoclonus (sudden, involuntary muscle contractions) at seizure onset and throughout the episode."
"The PPG signal may also sometimes be referred to as BVP in literature, and in this thesis the term BVP is used for the filtered output signal of a wearable device, whereas PPG is the raw sensor data. Because the raw output signal of a PPG sensor is a function of the amount of light falling into the photoelectric sensor, external light contaminating the reflected light from the sensor’s LED can heavily skew this signal [136, 160, 173]. This signal corruption is especially critical 2.2.

(c) Example of bad BVP signal quality, including a short period of slightly distorted pulses and severe artifacts caused by continued motion of the device. in wearable devices since the sensor might only be loosely attached to the body to keep it comfortable to wear. Any movement of the device or the body part it is attached to may result in the sensor lifting from the skin, which will invariably result in some motion artifact in the signal [174]. While some research presents methods to clean PPG signals from motion artifacts [175–177], including some using a simultaneously recorded ACC signal [178–180], they are only effective in removing minor short artifacts or those resulting from repetitive motions like running [181]. 2.2.4 Temperature Some wearables can record thermal activity by measuring the skin temperature (TMP) of the user’s body. Note that this does not capture the core temperature, so measured values are often lower than those commonly known for human core body temperature, for example, when determining fever, and are more prone to environmental influences [182]. Thus, TMP reflects a combination of the ambient and skin temperature at the recording location [183]. TMP signals are prone to sudden modulation as the environment changes, for example, due to the subject going outside in winter or putting on clothes that cover the body part to which 32 CHAPTER 2. RELATED WORK the wearable is attached. Furthermore, the baseline of the signal may change substantially in a seasonal context, as average temperatures would be higher during the summer than during the winter. Like other responses of the sympathetic nervous system, changes in peripheral body temperature can take multiple seconds or minutes and might occur delayed [184]. Therefore, artifacts in the temperature signal can register as sudden spikes or dips, for example, as the subject removes the wearable from the body for a short time. These could be detected by monitoring and thresholding the rate of amplitude change, similar to the artifacts seen in the EDA signal [159]. Temperature is commonly measured with wearables by one of two principles: Direct mea- surement with the sensor unit in immediate contact with the skin or indirect by infrared radia- tion measurements. The former methodology is most commonly achieved using a thermistor component, a resistor highly dependent on temperature [137]. The latter methodology can be implemented by thermopiles, components that connect different kinds of metal in series and thus exploit the thermoelectric effect, or pyroelectric sensors, measuring changes in the charge over the surface of pyroelectric crystals [185]. Concerning epilepsy, some research has investigated the role of thermoregulation [186, 187], however its causes, effects, and interac- tions are still poorly understood. Overall, there is no conclusive evidence as to the relevance of TMP measurements for epilepsy monitoring and the analyses presented in this thesis do not include this signal. 2.2.5 Other Sensors and Biosignals Electrodes attached to stationary systems in a hospital or dedicated monitoring unit usually capture electrographic signals like electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and EMG. Wearables recording these biosignal modalities do exist, although they frequently include cumbersome wires and adhesive electrode patches, making them less comfortable and more noticeable to wear, the opposite of how users prefer wearable devices to be [124, 188]. Furthermore, other biosignal recording systems that are not wearable but relevant to the topic are mattress sensors and at-home video and audio recording systems. EEG signals measure electric activity on the scalp as a surrogate marker of brain activ- ity [189]. Wet electrodes attached to the skin by conductive gel or dry electrodes using adhe- sive patches or caps typically capture EEG. The internationally used 10-20 system provides the standard electrode placement and naming convention [51, 52]. In epilepsy, EEG systems are most notably used in epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs) in combination with video monitor- ing, as outlined in Section 1.1.3. Wearable EEG devices for ambulatory recordings have existed for some time, traditionally as full-fledged electrode arrays in the form of a dry electrode cap worn over the whole head [190]. More recently, low- or single-channel EEG wearables are developing, using dry electrodes [73, 191] or even subcutaneously implanted electrodes [192] to measure the electrical activity of specific brain areas. Clinical ECG measures the heart’s and its muscles’ electrical activity by electrodes attached to the skin [193]. Multiple electrodes distributed over the thorax region and limbs facilitate proper ECG measurements [194]. Recorded data provide features such as HR, heart rate vari- ability, and further derived characteristics. Section 2.2.3 describes that PPG sensors are often used in wearable contexts to estimate these features. Nevertheless, some wearable ECG devices exist. For example, some devices use electrodes with wires similar to clinical systems [74], oth- ers have integrated the electrodes into chest bands or wearable fabric [193, 195], implantable 2.2. BIOSIGNAL MODALITIES 33 ECG sensors are sometimes used for ambulatory measurements [196], and even smartwatches measuring ECG exist [197]. Like ECG measurements, EMG records the electrical activity generated by muscle tissue when activated but is specific to skeletal muscles [198].","What is the significance of external light contamination on the raw output signal of a PPG sensor, and how does it affect the BVP signal as recorded by the Empatica E4 wearable device?",en,"External light contamination significantly affects the raw output signal of a Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, as it alters the amount of light falling into the photoelectric sensor. This alteration can heavily skew the PPG signal, which in turn impacts the Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) signal recorded by the Empatica E4 wearable device. The BVP is the filtered output signal of the wearable device, and its accuracy can be compromised due to this corruption caused by external light contamination. Additionally, since the sensor might only be loosely attached to the body in wearable devices, any movement of the device or the body part it is attached to may result in motion artifacts in the BVP signal, further impacting its accuracy.","External light contamination significantly skews the raw output signal of a PPG sensor. It can distort and introduce artifacts in the BVP signal recorded by the Empatica E4 wearable device, compromising its accuracy."
"Wearable EMG systems are often designed to fit around the limbs, measuring muscle activity during arm movements [199], for example, and have been used in a multitude of research [200–203]. In epilepsy biosignal monitoring, video and audio signals are paramount to discovering and classifying seizures [50, 100, 118]. However, the use of these sensors is often limited to EMUs (Section 1.1.3). Nevertheless, at-home video monitoring finds application in some cases where longer-term recordings, which are not feasible at the hospital, are necessary [204], and dedi- cated home-video recording systems are in development [205–207]. Similarly, pressure sensors under a mattress can indicate epileptic activity in seizures with convulsive motor manifesta- tions [208–210], but these sensors have some noteworthy disadvantages [102, 211], making them niche devices unattractive for regular clinical use. Section 2.5 compiles further related work regarding applications of wearables outside the context of epilepsy. 34 CHAPTER 2.

Data taken from Naganur et al. [108]. SD: standard deviation. In this section, the state-of-the-art literature concerning seizure detection with wearables is presented. In recent years a variety of review articles have been published from different groups, assessing wearable devices and their performances in seizure detection methodologies. A clinical practice guideline and standards for testing have been developed, introducing best practices for evaluating and validating seizure detection devices and methodologies [109, 212]. An exhaustive review of commercially available seizure detection devices has been published, compiling their capabilities and evidence of performance, if available [122]. Furthermore, re- cent reviews of studies predominantly evaluating convulsive TCSs have shown that mobile health devices are a promising method for epilepsy monitoring especially in out-of-hospital contexts (Figure 2.5) [108, 109, 121, 213]. However, while there are a number of studies eval- uating the performance of focal seizure (FS) detection, there still is a lack of evidence for a robust detection even in controlled conditions, much less in an ambulatory setting [110]. 2.3.1 Major Convulsive Seizures Primarily convulsive TCSs, that is, generalized tonic-clonic seizures or focal to bilateral tonic- clonic seizures (FBTCSs), are the most dangerous and severe seizure type due to their vio- lent pathology and high risk factor in the occurrence of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) [18, 19]. Thus, a robust detection of these seizures is of utmost importance not only in the development of alarm systems, but also the improvement of seizure diaries for 2.3. SEIZURE DETECTION WITH WEARABLES 35 the advancement of therapies. Furthermore, their symptoms inherently make TCSs the most straightforward seizure type to detect with wearables. Accordingly, there already are numer- ous published studies investigating these seizures with a variety of devices and methodolo- gies, some few even rated as phase 4 studies designed prospectively and with a predefined and fixed methodology [109, 212]. The current best state-of-the-art performances reported in some studies include sensitivities of >90 % and false alarm rates (FARs) of as low as 0.2 per 24 h. Monomodal detection of TCSs has been considered with almost every kind of relevant biosignal modality that can be measured from wearables. ACC is the most obvious modality to use for these convulsive motor seizures [134]. Johansson et al. [214], for example, use a wrist-worn inertial sensor to detect TCSs in adult patients visiting a video-electroencephalog- raphy monitoring unit. They evaluate three different supervised learning algorithms, with the best sensitivity resulting from a nearest neighbor model, detecting all the 37 TCSs, and the best FAR coming from a random forest model with 0.24 per day. Thus, they report performances comparable to some current multimodal systems. Kusmakar et al. [215] also use a wrist-worn ACC device to find TCSs with an outlier detection algorithm. They report a sensitivity of 95 % and a FAR of 0.72 per day. Like most epileptic seizures [216], TCSs have a strong cardiac component in their ictal and post-ictal phase, and cardiac abnormalities are a major risk factor concerning SUDEP [217]. Thus, the detection of TCSs with HR and heart rate variability (HRV) data from wearables has been investigated by several studies. Mohammadpour Touserkani et al. [218] record pho- toplethysmography (PPG) signals from a wrist- or ankle-worn wearable sensor and extract several features from it. They do not specifically investigate a detection algorithm, but de- scribe in detail the pre- and post-seizure periods of TCSs compared to a baseline in terms of these extracted features. The authors do this to avoid the severe motion artifacts PPG signals would have during the ictal phase of TCSs, which further highlights the lack of evidence of studies using PPG in monomodal TCS detection. There are some studies using electrocardiog- raphy (ECG) signals instead to detect convulsive seizures, but these are usually recorded from hospital monitoring systems [219, 220]. Beniczky et al. [203] and Zibrandtsen et al. [221] both use wearable EMG devices to detect TCSs in epilepsy patients, the former with a surface patch EMG device and the latter with an in-ear device. Both report sensitivities of above 90 % and less than one false positive per day, but neither comments on the comfort and acceptance of the device from the patients’ point of view. Furthermore, there have also been numerous studies in the past few years investigating the value of wearable electroencephalography (EEG) recordings [121]. Lastly, some efforts have also been made to detect convulsive seizures during the night with the help of at-home video systems, using video motion analysis to isolate periods of high activity [204, 222]. Multimodal detection of TCSs, that is, using two or more different biosignal modalities, with data from wearable devices, is the next logical advancements from the monomodal de- tection that the previously mentioned studies use. Onorati et al.","What are some additional applications of wearable technology outside the context of epilepsy biosignal monitoring, and what are the notable disadvantages associated with these applications?",en,"Some additional applications of wearable technology outside the context of epilepsy biosignal monitoring include at-home video monitoring for longer-term recordings necessary in certain cases where hospital recordings are not feasible, and dedicated home-video recording systems are being developed [204, 205-207]. Pressure sensors under a mattress can also indicate epileptic activity in seizures with convulsive motor manifestations, but these sensors have some notable disadvantages such as limited applicability and not being attractive for regular clinical use due to certain drawbacks [102, 211].",Additional applications of wearables outside epilepsy include at-home video monitoring for long-term recordings and dedicated home-video recording systems. Pressure sensors under mattresses indicate seizures with convulsive motor manifestations but have disadvantages making them niche devices. (Source: Section 2.5)
"[223, 224] use ACC and EDA data from a wrist-worn wearable device to detect primarily convulsive TCSs, although they also included a few FSs with tonic and clonic motor components in some of their evaluations. They train a support vector machine (SVM) model with feature sets from both modalities, and in their most recent work describing a prospective clinical validation study [223], they report sensitivities of up to 98 % and FARs below one per day. However, their detailed methodology and algorithms are proprietary, as the research group is directly linked to the manufacturer 36 CHAPTER 2. RELATED WORK of the wearable device they used, the Empatica E4 also used in the studies included here (see Section 3.1.3 and Section 3.2.1). Multimodal detection has also been investigated in other groups. Tang et al. [225] work with a wrist-worn wearable device (the same as Onorati et al. [223, 224]) to record ACC, EDA, and blood volume pulse (BVP) data, using different combinations of features from these sig- nals to train convolutional neural network models. Their data set includes TCSs as well as different types of FSs recorded from a predominantly pediatric cohort. For TCSs, they report a sensitivity of 80 % and a FAR of more than 13 per day when using the combination of ACC and EDA features. Interestingly, the combination using features from all three modalities did not perform best for any of the seizure types included in this study. Arends et al. [226] present a study with an upper-arm-worn wearable device recording ACC and PPG data exclusively during the night. Their methodology includes thresholds for features calculated from both signals, and additionally checks if the ACC signal indicates that the subject is lying down be- fore issuing an alarm. They report a sensitivity of 86 % and a FAR of 0.25 per 8-hour night. Cogan et al. [227] recorded HR, blood oxygen saturation, and EDA data with a wearable de- vice for the evaluation of a multi-stage seizure detection methodology. They included three convulsive seizures and 23 complex partial seizures (CPSs) in their data set, although they do not further specify whether the CPSs included motion manifestations. They report better FAR performances when extending their base methodology with a personalization step. Figure 2.5 shows the performances of some studies investigating TCS detection using both monomodal and multimodal methods [108]. A direct quantitative comparison of the results in this way is subject to uncertainties like differences in modalities, timespans of as much as 10 years between studies, or fundamental differences in methodologies, and thus unadvisable. Nevertheless, it gives an idea of rough average performances of related work, which helps to contextualize the results of this thesis, especially those of the TCS detection presented in Section 4.1. 2.3.2 Focal Motor Seizures FSs are the most commonly occurring type of epileptic seizure in the general population [15, 228, 229]. However, due to their relatively lower footprint and higher heterogeneity in terms of possible symptoms, they are substantially harder to detect from typical data recorded with wearable devices. Here, FSs do not include FBTCSs, even though they technically have a focal onset. In a later part of the thesis, Table 5.7 also compiles a list of related work that includes FS in the evaluation of various seizure detection methodologies. Vandecasteele et al. [74] use a SVM model to detect FSs with impaired awareness from HRV features, extracted from both ECG and PPG signals. They compare the performances of the models and conclude that the data from a wrist-worn PPG sensor are insufficient for seizure detection (sensitivity 32 %), whereas the wearable ECG data show promise (sensitivity 70 %). They specifically acknowledge motion artifacts as the main reason for the poor performance of the model based on PPG data. Munch Nielsen et al. [230] propose a multimodal FS detection and record ECG, ACC, and behind-the-ear EEG from wearable devices. In their analysis the authors included one patient with predominantly motor FSs with stereotypical tonic movement symptoms. Employing a SVM classifier, the authors report a sensitivity of up to 91 % and as low as 8 false alarms per day, depending on the decision threshold. 2.3. SEIZURE DETECTION WITH WEARABLES 37 Baumgartner et al. [231] extract features from surface EMG signals and use them in an amplitude analysis threshold detection methodology, detecting TCSs as well as a variety of different motor FSs. Among the FS types, they could correctly detect 50 % of seizures with tonic and/or clonic features, and 76 % of seizures with other symptoms like automatisms or hyperkinetic movements. They do not further specify a FAR, but show that automated detec- tion performance is similar to expert rater classification from the same data. Tang et al. [225] also include FSs in their data set (see Section 2.3.1), but do not further specify performances of their methodology for these seizure types in a comparable manner. However, they report that ACC is the best modality for focal tonic seizures, EDA together with BVP for automatisms, and BVP for behavior arrests. They also conclude that individualized models may improve detection performance. Vandecasteele et al. [191] use recordings from behind-the-ear EEG electrodes in a semi- automated FS detection. First, they had an expert rater visually annotate seizures in the data, and then used these labels to train a SVM detection model. In a patient-specific evaluation they could report a sensitivity of 69 % and 0.5 false alarms per day. The authors conclude that while these results seem low, they are still better than patient self-reports for these types of seizures. Due to their typically short duration of just a few seconds and low movement profile of slight jerks of a body part, myoclonic FSs are some of the hardest epileptic seizure types to detect from wearable device data. Thus, research investigating this problem is sporadic at best. Hyppönen et al. [232], for example, develop a video-based detection system for the eval- uation of myoclonic FSs. Specifically, they aim to automatically quantify myoclonic jerks by amplitude and frequency, estimated from optical flow of the video.","What specific combination of Accelerometry (ACC), Electdermal Activity (EDA), and Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) data from the Empatica E4 wearable device do Tang et al.

[225] use a combination of Accelerometry (ACC) and Electdermal Activity (EDA) data for detecting convulsive TCSs, reporting a sensitivity of 80% and a FAR of more than 13 per day."
"They report a high level of agreement of their methodology with clinical evaluation, however their data set included a limited number of subjects and video was recorded only during explicit and supervised tasks. 2.3.3 Focal Non-Motor and Other Seizures To date there is only sporadic research specifically investigating the detection of non-motor FSs with wearables. Some studies include these seizure types as a subset, sometimes more as an aside to convulsive seizures than their own seizure type. Not only is the detection of non-motor seizures an inherently more difficult task, but there is also less immediate need in general for a robust detection system for these seizures, as opposed to convulsive seizures that are much more intrusive and dangerous to the patient. Studies considering the detection of non-motor FSs, naturally, are often limited to non-movement-related biosignal modalities. Note also that for the purposes of this thesis, seizure semiologies such as oral automatisms or other small movements of the head are regarded as non-motor features, as they do not register on typical wearable movement sensors placed on the wrist or similar body locations. Tachycardia, that is, a substantial rise in HR over a short amount of time or a consis- tently high HR over longer periods, is a major symptom of epileptic seizures in general, and also non-motor seizures specifically [12, 29, 37]. Thus, many studies about the detection of non-motor seizures with wearables focus on modalities like ECG or PPG, and HR or HRV sig- nals, to detect events [41]. However, the restriction to only HR and HRV features has shown to be problematic when applied to general population cohorts. Ictal autonomic changes are limited to “responders”, that is, only some individual patients exhibit these symptoms during seizures [219, 233]. Furthermore, the current evidence of FS detection with monomodal sig- 38 CHAPTER 2. RELATED WORK nals shows performances of below 80 % sensitivity with often multiple false detections per hour [234, 235]. Munch Nielsen et al. [230] propose a multimodal FS detection and record ECG, ACC, and behind-the-ear EEG from wearable devices. In their analysis the authors included two patients with predominantly non-motor FSs with symptoms like auras and behavioral arrests. Employ- ing a SVM classifier, the authors report that all non-motor seizures could be found, with FARs of 5 and 13 per day for the two participants. Vandecasteele et al. [236] evaluate a multimodal detection algorithm to find predominantly FSs with impaired awareness using ECG and behind-the-ear EEG. While the authors give no further information on the seizure pathology or potential ictal movements, the application of wearable EEG suggests that most seizures would not have had prevalent motor features due to the motion artifacts they would have caused in the signal. They report an average sensitivity of 89 % with FARs of less than two per hour over three different cohort data sets. Of note concerning the general body of related work on FS detection is that many studies do not further specify if movements during or in the peri-ictal proximity of the seizures were included in their analysis [74, 227, 237, 238]. Studies will usually categorize seizures by one of the clinical classifications (e.g., Fisher et al. [27]), but if there is no specific focus on motor seizures in their evaluation and modalities like ACC are not used, information about move- ments during seizures is often omitted. While the inclusion of this information may not seem immediately relevant for this type of evaluation, it is important to include it regardless. Ar- tifacts from movement are a major disruptive factor for all physiological modalities recorded from wearables. Thus, including at least a binary movement or no movement categorization during seizures is fundamentally relevant for the interpretation of wearable seizure detection results. 2.3.4 Relation to Own Work The research presented in this thesis specifically targets the detection of epileptic seizures with motor manifestations of the limbs, both with convulsive TCSs (Section 2.3.1) and FSs (Sec- tion 2.3.2) with tonic or clonic semiology. For the detection convulsive TCS, both monomodal and multimodal methodologies have been shown to be successful. Figure 2.5 actually seems to indicate a preference for monomodal detection with ACC signals which, on average, trends to- wards lower FARs than multimodal detection. However, this does not account for differences in wearable sensors, study protocols, or recent developments in the state-of-the-art. Current studies using multimodal detection with both the ACC and EDA modalities, including the analysis included in this thesis (Section 4.1.3), have reported better results than the average monomodal detection using just ACC. Related work concerning the detection of FSs, with or without movement components, is even more heterogeneous. At the same time, there are also less published studies investi- gating the wearable non-EEG detection of exclusively FSs, as compared to studies including TCSs. Furthermore, current work generally does not highlight the need for, and utility of, in- dividualized detection models. Thus, the analyses included in this thesis, specifically the work included in Section 5.2, represents a new and further step towards robust FS detection. While the work presented here focuses on seizures with epileptic movements, it could also be used similarly for non-motor FSs, possibly with a different combination of biosignals that omits ACC in favor of other signals representing the autonomic nervous system. 2.4. SEIZURE PREDICTION AND FORECASTING 39 2.4 Seizure Prediction and Forecasting Seizure prediction, as opposed to detection, specifically refers to the intention of predicting seizures before they happen, with the goal of potential intervention. Seizure forecasting is sometimes regarded as a subfield of study that usually doesn’t aim to predict a specific future seizure but estimates the likelihood of seizures happening at some point in the future [239, 240]. Both prediction and forecasting have been shown to be possible for some patients with epilepsy in controlled retrospective studies, but application in the real world is still lack- ing [240, 241]. While seizure prediction research predominantly started by using in-hospital electroencephalography (EEG) data, other biomarkers have since been introduced, in particu- lar also with the application of wearable devices, looking towards ultra-long-term ambulatory forecasting [53, 60, 239].","What specific challenges does research face when it comes to detecting non-motor focal seizures using wearable devices, and why might there be less immediate need for a robust detection system for these types of seizures compared to convulsive seizures?",en,"Research faces several challenges when it comes to detecting non-motor focal seizures using wearable devices. First, the detection of non-motor seizures is inherently more difficult because these types of seizures may not produce visible movements or other signs that can be easily detected by conventional wearable movement sensors. Second, studies considering the detection of non-motor FSs are often limited to non-movement-related biosignal modalities. This means that researchers must find other ways to identify these seizures, such as changes in heart rate (tachycardia) or other physiological signs.

There might be less immediate need for a robust detection system for non-motor seizures compared to convulsive seizures because convulsive seizures are much more intrusive and dangerous to the patient. In contrast, non-motor seizures may not be as noticeable or disruptive, so they may not require immediate medical attention. However, it is important to note that even though there may be less immediate need for a robust detection system for these types of seizures, they can still cause significant problems for the patient if left untreated over time.",Challenges in detecting non-motor focal seizures include their inherent complexity and less immediate need due to less intrusive nature compared to convulsive seizures.
"Generally speaking, seizure prediction methodologies found in literature can be separated into two broad categories: those that explicitly leverage cyclic structures in the re-occurrence of seizures, and those that do not. At first glance, epilepsy seems to appear as random oc- currences of seizures. However, rhythmic manifestation in circadian1, multidien2, or even circannual3 cycles can be found in a considerable portion of patients [242, 243]. Concerning circadian rhythms, differences between daytime and nighttime periods are the driving fac- tor, affecting the autonomic nervous system [244], and thus possibly the occurrence of some seizure types [42, 245]. These rhythms can be captured by wearable devices recording data like heart rate (HR) or electrodermal activity [246, 247]. Multidien HR cycles could also be linked to seizure occurrence, with the data being recorded by a wearable device with a photo- plethysmography sensor [248]. Data from wearable devices have also been used in some studies investigating seizure fore- casting without expressly looking for rhythmic patterns. Notably, deep learning approaches have emerged as successful in direct seizure prediction [249, 250]. In a seminal study, ultra- long-term intracranial EEG data recorded with electrodes implanted on the surface of the brain were successfully used to estimate seizure likelihood in a small cohort of patients [54]. In an- other study using intracranial EEG recorded in the hospital environment, early data until up to 10 seconds after seizure onset could infer the seizure type of the ongoing seizure [251]. While not strictly seizure prediction, this result may still provide value towards early warning and intervention systems, specifically in those seizures where clinical symptom onset is delayed after EEG onset. Some research has also investigated the feasibility of seizure predictors from metadata such as manual seizure diaries kept by the patients [252]. There has notably also been some progress made towards crowdsourcing the problem of seizure prediction [253, 254]. Potential solutions are dependent on evaluation with ultra-long- term data recordings that include multiple seizures over periods of sometimes months, and this kind of data are generally not readily available to all researchers. Disseminating data sets in a crowdsourcing manner may help substantially in improving prediction and forecasting algorithms. 124-hour 2multi-day 3yearly 40 CHAPTER 2. RELATED WORK 2.5 Non-epileptic Seizures and Similar Conditions In the wider field of general healthcare there are a variety of conditions and adverse events that can manifest with symptoms comparable to those of epileptic seizures. The most imme- diate relative are psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNESs), which are also often explicitly considered in epilepsy research. Further, there are a number of diseases that are symptomat- ically related to epilepsy, like multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), both of which include motor spasms or tremors in their list of possible symptoms. In addition, there are some more distantly related problems in general healthcare-related activity tracking. A PNES is a seizure event initiated by psychological mechanisms, as opposed to specific epileptic activity in the brain. One of the main outcomes of in-hospital monitoring units is the differential diagnosis between epileptic seizures and PNES, and there are a variety of different diagnostic tools to aid in this effort [255]. Some research has investigated distinction between the two from physiological non-video-electroencephalography data. For example, muscle ac- tivation patterns, captured by surface electromyography signals, have been found to indicate the type of seizure event [201, 256]. Similarly, movement patterns captured by accelerome- try (ACC) were used to distinguish between convulsive epileptic seizures, PNES, and normal movements [142, 257]. MS is a disease of the central nervous system characterized by a wide range of symp- toms, including motor dysfunctions which can manifest as walking impairments. Therefore, gait analysis has been a target of research, employing ACC sensors as a source of movement data [258, 259]. In this context, wearable devices have similar advantages as in epilepsy re- search: they provide continuous data in a long-term ambulatory setting while being unobtru- sive and easy to use [260–262]. PD is a neurodegenerative condition that manifests in different symptoms, with involun- tary tremors being a fundamental indication that includes a motor component. PD is also a highly progressive disease, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring and manage- ment [263]. Therefore, ACC-based monitoring has been investigated to both classify and quan- tify tremors using, for example, smartphones [264] or wrist-worn wearables [265, 266]. Automatically detecting falls would give meaningful opportunity for timely intervention and assistance, and research on this topic has seen an upsurge in recent years [267]. Not only is it highly relevant for the care of elderly people, but there is a meaningful connection to epilepsy as well, with some seizure types like atonic motor seizures often resulting in the patient suddenly falling to the ground [268]. Fall detection has been attempted with a variety of different sensors, among them audio/video systems [269] and ACC sensors [270]. Lastly, there are a multitude of other applications of wearable sensors in healthcare [271], like monitoring physical activity [272], sleep quality assessment [273], observation of obses- sive compulsive disorder [274], affect recognition [116], gait analysis [275], cardiac monitor- ing [276], diabetes treatment [277], or smoking cessation [278]. 2.6. SUMMARY 41 2.6 Summary This chapter compiled the state-of-the-art literature in epilepsy monitoring and seizure detec- tion with wearable devices. The usage of wearables in epilepsy research has only begun in the last 10-15 years, but since then the number of publications on this topic grew exponentially. Robust monitoring of epilepsy not only in the hospital but also at home is necessary to en- able effective diagnosis, intervention, management, and research. While the gold standard of video-electroencephalography is used in monitoring units, it is not feasible for ambulatory as- sessment, and wearables could fill this gap. However, patients also want effective, affordable, and inconspicuous devices. Wearables can record a variety of different biosignals, some of which are relevant to epilep- sy. Accelerometry captures movements of the body, data which can be used to train detection models for epileptic seizures with movement manifestations. Electrodermal activity sensors record electrical properties of the skin that can change during seizures, but are dependent on dry electrodes and skin contact.","Is it possible to predict epileptic seizures using cyclic patterns observed over circadian, multidien, or even circannual cycles, and if so, can such patterns be captured by wearable devices like those recording heart rate or electrodermal activity?",en,"Yes, it is possible to predict epileptic seizures using cyclic patterns observed over circadian, multidien, or even circannual cycles. These patterns can indeed be captured by wearable devices like those recording heart rate (HR) or electrodermal activity. The data recorded by these devices can then be used in studies investigating seizure forecasting, including some that do not explicitly look for rhythmic patterns. In addition, deep learning approaches have been successful in direct seizure prediction.","Yes, it is possible to predict epileptic seizures using cyclic patterns observed over circadian, multidien, or even circannual cycles. These patterns can indeed be captured by wearable devices like those recording heart rate or electrodermal activity."
"Photoplethysmography signals can be used to estimate heart rate (HR) and other cardiac features, but the sensors are very susceptible to motion artifacts. Other biosignal modalities exist and are recorded by a number of different sensors, but these are not relevant to the content of this thesis. Seizure detection can be monomodal or multimodal, that is, using one or more biosig- nal modality, but a general preference is not obvious from current literature and depends on context. The detection of tonic-clonic seizures has the highest-performing evidence in re- lated work, and phase 4 prospective ambulatory studies are beginning to yield results. Motor focal seizures (FSs) can be difficult to detect, but some evidence shows that there is good po- tential for robust wearable seizure detection systems, especially if model personalization is implemented. Non-motor FSs are possibly the hardest to detect with wearables, relying on physiological modalities like HR, and there is little evidence in literature so far that attempts detection with non-electroencephalography (EEG) data. Both the prediction of seizures and the detection of non-epileptic seizure-like events are not directly involved in the research included in this thesis. However, they are closely related in that general concepts of machine learning can be applied similarly to these topics. Seizure prediction aims to predict seizures before they happen, or in the case of forecasting, to esti- mate a probability of seizures occurring in a specific time frame. Generally, this is done either by leveraging predictable cyclic structures in the occurrences of seizures for some patients, or by deep learning modeling with wearable data. As these tasks require a lot of data over months or years, data sharing and crowdsourcing has a high priority. Non-epileptic seizures are seizure-like events that do not show typical epileptic EEG patterns, and the closest relative in this regard are psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. To correctly diagnose these, epilepsy monitoring units perform differential diagnosis. Other diseases with partially similar symp- toms to epilepsy and where wearables are used in research are multiple sclerosis or Parkin- son’s disease. The analysis methodologies presented in this thesis could be modified to enable the detection of events like these, likely involving the use of different types of biosignals or features thereof. From a broader perspective, the use of wearables in epilepsy is only one medical application, with others including fields like fall detection, sleep quality assessment, or cardiological applications. This chapter established the context of current related work in the field of seizure detec- tion with wearable non-EEG sensors, both in terms of relevant methodologies and qualitative 42 CHAPTER 2. RELATED WORK performances, facilitating a placement of the results included in the following two chapters within the state-of-the-art. Concluding from current developments in the field, the detec- tion of epileptic seizures with low-profile, low-cost, non-EEG wearables is a very promising approach, and the research presented in this thesis takes a meaningful step towards robust detection systems.

METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN T his chapter contextualizes the thesis within the scope of the data collection studies con- ducted to gather wearable biosignal data from patients with epilepsy. Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse - Central Nervous System was a collaborative European research project that included, among other studies for other neurological disorders, several epilepsy-centered data collection studies. Specifically, patients with epilepsy were recruited at the epilepsy mon- itoring units of the University Medical Center Freiburg (UKF) and the King’s College Hospital London (KCL). Both in-hospital and ambulatory data collection was implemented, however, this thesis only includes data from the former. Data collection in the patients’ everyday life, while an important experience, was not done with the evaluation of seizure detection method- ology in mind. Rather, it was primarily focused on assessing the feasibility of such an ambu- latory study with wearables in general. The first section of this chapter (Section 3.1) was previously published as a collaborative journal article [103] commenting on the wearable study experiences of four different interna- tional epilepsy centers, including those that this thesis’ data set was recorded at. Therefore, it includes information on data collection procedures, wearable device choices, considerations regarding the reporting of results for seizure detection studies, and other such discussion.","What biosignal modalities would be most effective for detecting motor and non-motor focal seizures in a wearable system, especially when considering the potential of model personalization?",en,"The biosignal modality that would be most effective for detecting motor focal seizures in a wearable system, especially when considering the potential of model personalization, is likely Electroencephalography (EEG). However, it's worth noting that there is some evidence suggesting good potential for robust systems using physiological modalities like Heart Rate (HR) as well. For detecting non-motor focal seizures, there is currently little evidence in literature to suggest any other biosignal modality besides EEG. However, efforts are ongoing to explore the use of HR and other physiological signals for this purpose.","HR biosignal modalities could be effective for motor FSs with model personalization. Non-motor FSs might require physiological data like EEG, but evidence is limited."
"As this thesis’ author’s main contributions in this article were the data collection studies at the aforementioned UKF and KCL sites, only information concerning these were included in this chapter. Extending on those notes, Section 3.2 gives further details on the selected wearable device, the technical implementation of the data collection, and basic biosignal data preprocessing done for all the analyses included in the remainder of the thesis. These individual data analy- sis studies will in turn include more information on methodologies specific to the respective evaluation, like distinct feature set computations and seizure detection models. 3.1.

Seizure detection may serve many dif- ferent purposes, from closed-loop treatment of acute seizures and impending status epilepti- cus [279, 280], to retrospective assessment of clinical seizure burden and assessment of the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), as well as evaluation of clinical devices or medication trials [281]. Given the unreliability of self-reported seizure diaries [54, 102, 282], an accurate seizure detection device could be used to optimize medical treatment, avoiding under- treatment due to unreported seizures, and minimizing unnecessary side effects due to seizure over-reporting. Offline detection could contribute to the diagnosis of non-epileptic paroxys- mal events, from psychogenic seizures [142, 201, 257, 283] to cardiogenic events. Seizure de- tection devices may also be studied for their potential to measure disease severity, for example, pathologies like ictal autonomic changes [153], ictal surface electromyography patterns [284], post-ictal immobility [105], and post-ictal central apnea [285] are all potentially measurable by wearable devices and are associated with post-ictal generalized electroencephalography suppression, a risk factor for SUDEP. The particular seizure semiology types targeted in a study may affect the study design, de- vice choice, and data annotation protocols. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures and focal motor seizures with limb involvement may require movement or electromyography sensor devices and may prompt placement of devices on the body segment with greatest ictal movements, whereas non-motor seizure types like focal impaired awareness seizures may require devices 46 CHAPTER 3. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN that sense autonomic biomarkers such as electrodermal activity, heart rate (HR), or skin tem- perature, or a combination of these. Detection of daytime seizures requires wearable devices to be mobile and to be robust to patient movement, whereas devices for detection of noctur- nal seizures may be stationary and attached to the patient [226, 286] or the bed [208, 287], or a camera may be pointed at the patient from a fixed location [204]. Device acceptability and adherence by patients are essential in seizure detection, and device studies should include assessment of acceptability in the overall study aims [130]. The primary aims of the studies included in this thesis were to study the detection feasibil- ity and optimal combinations of bio-signals obtained from non-electroencephalography (EEG) wearable sensors, for the detection of convulsive tonic-clonic seizures and focal seizures with motor and/or autonomic features, as compared with video-electroencephalography (vEEG) ground truth. Further aims were the assessment of patients’ acceptance towards wearing the devices and the technical feasibility of conducting studies with remote measurement technol- ogy in cohorts of epilepsy patients. Policies and Agreements The process to obtain ethical approval from an institutional review board or ethics committee (EC) may be time-consuming and requires careful planning. Essential steps include delineating a clear research plan and developing the study protocol, but also seeking agreements with device manufacturers, interacting with hospital authorities, and arranging monitoring plans. The process of obtaining informed consent is regulated by principles embodied in the cur- rent biomedical research on human subjects [288], which also considers the needs of vulner- able populations (e.g., children, cognitively impaired or unconscious patients) [289]. Com- prehensive information must be provided to enable people to voluntarily decide whether to participate in a research study and is essential for valid informed consent as defined by the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice [288]. Despite the low invasiveness of wearable devices, studies involving wearable devices are subject to these regulations, and in particular the trans- fer and sharing of anonymized data with other groups (see Section 3.1.5) requires approval. In particular, sharing anonymized data internationally can be heavily regulated and may require specific consent by the research subject. Opt-in and opt-out policies, also called nudges, have the tendency to promote one choice in favor of the other, while still keeping the choice easy to avoid [290]. Of course, this will also need to conform to local data protection regulations. Each study center must be guided by its country’s local policies and regulations, and addi- tional approvals may be needed when testing devices without existing Conformité Européenne (CE) or US Food and Drug Administration approvals. Such studies may be considered clini- cal trials or performance evaluation studies, requiring additional documentation and in some cases authorization by government regulatory bodies. The rules vary in different countries, and this generates disparities in how devices can be tested and scientific data acquired. In this thesis, the device used for data collection already had a CE mark as a medical device, and thus the studies were not considered as clinical trials. Another important consideration is the security rules governing the computer network infrastructure in the hospital environment. Hospitals regulate and limit access to internal net- works to protect sensitive data, and specific approvals are often required to use existing wire- less connections or create new networks.","What parts of the Bruno, Elisa and Böttcher et al.'s 2021 publication on ""Wearable devices for seizure detection"" were removed or edited from Section 3.1 Study Procedures?",en,"Certain parts of the Bruno, Elisa and Böttcher et al.'s 2021 publication on ""Wearable devices for seizure detection,"" specifically related to the individual methodologies such as distinct feature set computations, seizure detection models, and other specific evaluation details, were removed or edited from Section 3.1 Study Procedures to fit into the composition of this complete thesis.","Parts of the data related to distinct feature set computations, seizure detection models, and more specific methodologies for individual data analysis studies were removed or edited from Section 3.1 Study Procedures in Bruno et al.'s 2021 publication."
"Data safety and protection are important consider- ations, especially with the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) governing data collection and transfer inside the EU and with international collaborators. All 3.1. STUDY PROCEDURES 47 clinical institutions based within the EU must follow these rules, whether collecting data or receiving data from partners outside the EU. The studies presented in this thesis followed these principles and considerations, acquir- ing approval from the local EC and data protection office. The studies were designated as “miscellaneous”, that is, neither medical drug nor medical device trials. A detailed participant information sheet was given to each patient included in the study, and each provided written informed consent. Study Population Selecting the study population to appropriately address the research question is crucial in study design. In particular, it is important to match the subject characteristics, epilepsy type, or seizure semiology in the study cohort to the goals of the study. In these prospective cohort studies patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy were recruited when they presented for epilepsy care at the hospital epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU), and were asked to wear one or more wearable devices. While in the EMU, patients were monitored for seizures via vEEG, which was recorded along with the sensor data from the wearables. As physiological responses and signal alterations during epileptic seizures may vary across age groups, the inclusion of participants of different ages needs to be taken into account. In the studies included here, the lower and upper limit of age for study participants ranged be- tween 7 years and 80 years, respectively. Moreover, at the stage of protocol development, it is important to identify those comorbidities that may interfere with study adherence or with data collection and quality. Patients with conditions impeding the ability to participate (cog- nitive, psychiatric, acutely ill), to wear the device (skin conditions), or with frequent vigorous involuntary movements (e.g., chorea, athetosis) were excluded from the studies. Baseline characteristics of the included participants allow the population under study to be better characterized, the results obtained to be understood and contextualized, and for gen- eralizability of the data to be discussed. For all the study participants, data collected during the study period included basic demographic characteristics including age and gender, clin- ical information, and seizure characteristics including etiology, localization, type, onset, and frequency of seizures and medications. During the studies presented in this thesis, patients with epilepsy were recruited at the EMUs of the King’s College Hospital London (KCL) and the University Medical Center Freiburg (UKF). Table 3.1 gives an overview of some of the relevant information and key demographics regarding these data collection procedures [174]. 3.1.2 Data Collection and Technical Infrastructure Video EEG recordings and seizure annotation Recording data continuously over days with the support of vEEG is essential to capture an adequate number of events and to reliably identify and characterize seizures through a gold standard. In the studies included here, as part of the clinical workup, patients were admitted to the EMU and connected via scalp electrodes to an EEG monitoring system within view of a video camera. The length of stay in the EMU varied based on the patient’s clinical care. The majority 48 CHAPTER 3.

Trained personnel are needed to perform standard vEEG monitoring, including electrode placement according to the 10-20 international system, and to maintain high-quality record- ings. EEG recordings were fully reviewed, and seizure onset and offset were annotated, in ad- dition to supporting information including seizure semiology and ictal focus. The two centers where data were recorded, UKF and KCL, jointly developed and adhered to a review and anno- tation protocol specifying reviewing terminology and methodology to guarantee consistency in reporting clinical phenomena across patients. This included, for example, definitions of autonomic features such as tachycardia, which is ambiguously defined in epilepsy-related lit- erature; determination of duration of impaired awareness, which is not always actively tested for; and an agreement on how to consistently store this information in a shared database for collaboration. The labeled vEEG recordings were then transferred to a secure server for storage and analysis, and seizure onset and offset times were applied to the simultaneously collected wearable recordings. Wearable data collection and device integration Data collection with wearables is generally done in one of two approaches: offline collection, where the data are stored locally on the device and then downloaded at a later time, or online collection, where the data are streamed continually via a wireless connection to an external device. During online collection, the wearable device usually has a much shorter battery life, since wireless data transmission adds substantially to the overall energy consumption. However, the maximum recording time in offline collection is constrained by the internal storage capacity of the device. Furthermore, the data must be manually downloaded from the device, potentially requiring regular patient participation. This process can be automated during online collection, at the expense of a potential for data loss due to connection problems. An added benefit to data streaming is the possibility of live data processing and visualization, allowing caretakers and study personnel to evaluate data as they come in. Live data streaming is also a key requirement for any intervention or alarm system not directly built into the wearable device. For the studies included here, performed at the epilepsy wards of KCL and UKF, online data streaming was used. The wearable devices were constantly connected to a companion device 3.1.","What specific measures were taken to ensure data safety and protection compliance with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the studies presented in this thesis, given that they were neither medical drug nor medical device trials?",en,"The studies presented in this thesis ensured data safety and protection compliance with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by acquiring approval from the local Ethics Committee (EC) and data protection office.

Remaster of Figure 2 in Bruno et al. [103]. via Bluetooth, and a custom-built Android application was used to receive the raw data directly from the wearable device and upload them to a data storage server on the clinic premises (Fig- ure 3.1). All components of this system like the Android app and the server framework are open-source software available on GitHub [291]. Wearable devices were exchanged twice per day, in the morning and evening, to allow for battery charging given the shorter battery life in streaming mode. There were also frequent problems with the devices’ Bluetooth connec- tivity. The wearables often disconnected from the companion device, either due to the patient walking out of range or due to other, sometimes unexplained reasons. This would lead to frequent and extensive data loss (see Section 3.1.4, data quality and completeness), especially since the wearable device did not offer an on-device data buffer or automatic reconnect to the companion device. Synchronization between wearable and vEEG data Time synchronization between an external device and the vEEG is particularly important in the field of epilepsy research. The clinical seizure onset, used as the ground truth in developing models for seizure detection and prediction, can often be pinpointed with sub-second precision by clinical experts. Thus synchronizing the internal time of the wearable device to the time of the vEEG system is essential for data analysis. Furthermore, depending on the specific device used, internal inaccuracies can cause small shifts in the timekeeping between individual biosignal data streams. There are two principal ways of achieving synchronization between a wearable device and a vEEG system. The most accurate and technically more advanced way is to directly and pre- cisely adjust the on-device timekeeping of the wearables to the time used in the clinical vEEG system, for example, by some wireless connection. This will give millisecond synchronization between the two time bases, but may require some technical set-up beforehand, and it might not even be available as an option if the wearable device does not support this operation. The 50 CHAPTER 3. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN second way of achieving synchronization is through the study staff, who can manually induce a visible and recognizable change in the wearable’s recorded signals while also showing this action on the video or EEG signal. Alternatively, an artifact or label can be placed simultane- ously during the device and EEG recording, and then be confirmed by EEG, as some standard vEEG systems suffer from an occasional minor desynchronization of the EEG and video. The data streams can then be synchronized retrospectively by adjusting the wearable data times- tamps to align the events with the vEEG. Although the data streams can be synchronized to sub-second precision with this method, it requires manual modification of the data. Both methods are susceptible to the internal drift of timekeeping in the wearable, caused by inaccuracies in the real-time-clock circuits in these devices. This drift can accumulate over time, up to several seconds of inaccuracy over several hours of recording. Therefore, it is advisable to repeat the synchronization process periodically during the recording. The auto- mated method is more suitable for this, as the synchronization could be triggered, for example, every few minutes. Another method to deal with drifting timestamps directly is to measure individual calibration parameters for each device that is used in a study. Thereby, the precise sampling rate for a device is found by a calibration procedure, to a degree of accuracy that allows for a later recalibration of the timestamps in the recorded signals. Synchronizing the wearable data with the vEEG system can also enable integration of both into a common data viewer, which facilitates a better understanding of abstract wearable data in the context of the actual clinical setting. In the studies included here, the automated method was employed. Because the devices are programmed to synchronize themselves to the clock of the companion Android device when- ever they are first connected via Bluetooth, it is only necessary to synchronize the Android devices to the vEEG time base, which can be done easily via a network connection. Conse- quently, each center synchronized their wearable devices each time they were exchanged for battery charging, with intervals ranging from twice per day to every 2 days. Section 3.2 gives a more detailed description of the wearable device and technical infrastructure implemented for the studies. 3.1.3 Devices Across the two study sites, KCL and UKF, several different wearable devices were used for data collection from study participants. Among the most prominent devices were Biovotion’s Eve- rion, IMEC’s sensor bracelet, Epitel’s Epilog, Byteflies’ Dots, and Empatica’s E4. The data quality and patient acceptance of some of these devices have been reported previously [159, 173, 292]. In the studies included in this thesis, only data from the Empatica E4 device (Section 3.2.1; Empatica Inc., Boston, MA, USA) were used for further analysis, as it was used in the overall largest amount of participants. Wearable devices of the types used in clinical epilepsy studies can be categorized in various ways, all of which should factor into the decision when selecting a device for a study: Medical certification: Wearables, in general, are employed in many different fields beyond medicine, so for use in studies as described here, the certification as a medical device can be an important factor. IMEC’s sensor bracelet for example, as a prototype device, is not independently certified, whereas the Empatica E4 has a European CE class IIa certification as a medical device. 3.1. STUDY PROCEDURES 51 Modalities: Different devices record different biosignals at different sample rates, so an in- formed decision needs to be made about exactly what is needed to facilitate the out- comes of the given study. Multimodal devices are generally regarded as more effective and versatile [293–295], whereas a device recording only one modality may be sufficient for a very specific task.",How is data collected and transferred from the wearable device for seizure detection in an EMU using the open-source software available on GitHub?,en,"Data is collected and transferred from the wearable device for seizure detection in an EMU using an open-source Android application.

However, there were frequent problems with the devices' Bluetooth connectivity, leading to potential data loss.","Data is collected directly from the wearable device via a custom Android application, then uploaded to a data storage server on the clinic premises using Bluetooth and open-source software available on GitHub."
"Epitel’s Epilog, for example, provides only a single-channel EEG signal, whereas the Empatica E4 records four different types of raw biosignal data. Data mode: Generally, there are two modes in data collection, online or offline, as described further in Section 3.1.2. In most cases a given device supports only one mode for record- ing data, so either the study protocol needs to be adjusted to support the device, or an appropriate device needs to be chosen for an already established study protocol. The on- line streaming mode is a requirement for systems that should include any kind of alarm or intervention. Byteflies’ Dots, for example, support only offline recordings, whereas the Empatica E4 has the option to employ both methods. Battery life: With current battery technology, the battery life of smaller devices or those that employ online raw data streaming is usually measured in hours, whereas some- what larger devices with offline, on-device data storage can sometimes be active for days without the need to recharge. IMEC’s sensor bracelet, for example, has a typical battery life of seven days, while the Empatica E4 has a manufacturer-specified battery life of 24 h to 48 h, although in these studies empty batteries after half that time were often observed. This was in part due to the shorter battery lifespan when the E4 is used in streaming mode. Device placement: Wearables are usually placed at a specific part of the body, which can be influenced by the study protocol and should be considered when choosing a device. In turn, the placement of the device may affect both the sensitivity and specificity of a prospective seizure detector. The Empatica E4, for example, is normally worn around the wrist, while the Byteflies’ Dots can be attached to any part of the body by use of an adhesive patch. Furthermore, research-grade devices, such as the Empatica E4, often have several advan- tages and disadvantages over other devices that are marketed directly to consumer end-users. Access to raw data is a necessity for many research studies, but something that consumer- grade devices and services rarely provide. Furthermore, companies offering research-grade devices are sometimes open to collaboration, for example, by supporting researchers with specialized knowledge of device capabilities. On the other hand, research devices are often more expensive than their consumer coun- terparts and can be more cumbersome and uncomfortable to wear, since the device’s aesthetic design is not a priority for the manufacturer. However, patients consistently gave more pos- itive feedback on the wearability of the Empatica E4, as compared to the Biovotion Everion, which is a device on the market for regular consumers to buy [292]. 3.1.4 Reporting Results Usability challenges and users’ perspectives Wearable devices are progressively becoming an available and innovative tool for continuous seizure monitoring. People living with epilepsy have expressed interest in using new tech- 52 CHAPTER 3. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN nologies in their daily life [125] and several unmet needs might be addressed by adopting digital solutions into health care services [125, 296]. The research focused on hypothetical scenarios has highlighted that motivation to use wearables is not driven only by the accuracy and reliability of the device performance. A design incorporating comfort and ease of use is also essential for acceptance and long-term adoption [292]. Obtaining feedback from patients after direct experience wearing devices is the only way to fully understand the practical and technical issues faced [297]. However, feedback on device comfort and usability has been col- lected only sporadically in previous studies, and information reflecting the direct experience of study participants is missing. The limited number of investigations exploring users’ direct experience reported improvement of quality of life for both patients and caregivers [297], a benefit to autonomy and increasing independence in activities [226, 297], as well as a gener- ally good evaluation of technology usability [226, 298]. Barriers to use, as reported, include discomfort in wearing the device during sleep, technical difficulties, and the burden of adding another aspect to routine epilepsy care [297]. In addition to the key requirements of a reliable and accurate performance, a successful integration of digital solutions into a patient pathway requires acceptance of the technology. The latter is required for long-term engagement, which is essential to a good detection perfor- mance, and to optimize the benefit to the patient. To identify and avoid potential barriers to a long-term engagement with the technology, patients’ views and requirements need to inform the development of the technology and study design, and users’ opinions on usability and acceptability should be collected systematically. Methods to obtain feedback from study par- ticipants range from a focus group (useful during the first stages to guide research questions and research development), interviews (at set time points during the study, for example, study end or in case of participants’ withdrawal), collection of participants’ observations (any time in the course of the study), and questionnaires (allowing direct comparisons between subjects and the identification of subject-related factors influencing their experience in the study). At KCL and UKF, participants’ experience and the perceived ease of use and comfort of the tech- nology were assessed at the end of the study using a self-administered Technology Acceptance Model Fast Form (TAM-FF) [299]. Moreover, in a group of study participants, the experience of wearing multimodal sensor devices was also assessed via semi-structured interviews covering questions on their experiences and concerns using the wearables, their thoughts about ambu- latory use of wearables, and their reasons for stopping to wear the device if applicable [72]. Data quality and completeness The value of collected data can be assessed by data completeness and data quality. Data qual- ity measures evaluate properties like the noisiness, accuracy, and potential information gain of the data, whereas data completeness gauges data loss during recording. In the context of exploratory research, both data quality and completeness are of utmost importance, and sev- eral steps were taken to reflect that need. Collecting raw, unprocessed data from wearable devices, forgoing any internal processing, can facilitate the assessment of data quality. This will give a complete and clear picture of the suitability of the device for the task at hand.",What are the main factors to consider when choosing a biosignal device for a study protocol: data mode (online or offline) and battery life?,en,"When choosing a biosignal device for a study protocol, the two main factors to consider are data mode (whether it is online or offline) and battery life. The data mode will determine whether the device can stream data continuously (online mode) or record data locally for later analysis (offline mode). This decision may be influenced by the need for real-time alarms or interventions. Battery life is another important factor, as smaller devices with online streaming capabilities usually have shorter battery lifespans measured in hours, while larger devices with offline storage can last for days without recharging. The choice of device placement will also depend on the study protocol and where the data collection needs to take place.","Main factors for choosing a biosignal device are data mode (online or offline) to fit the study protocol, and battery life considering the duration of the study."
"Fur- thermore, sharing raw data across different research sites and groups can enhance the value of the data set, advance the understanding of data complexities, and facilitate scientific explo- ration of the data. Another important tool to effectively assess data value is the use of data dashboards. These dashboards usually take the form of a website that aggregates data com- pleteness and quality measures as new data come in and displays it with intuitive charts and 3.1. STUDY PROCEDURES 53 tables. Especially in the context of live data streaming, they can monitor system function and user adherence. Gaps in the data can be caused by several issues related to data collection. A common cause of data loss is the limited battery life of the device. Charging the battery takes time (typically hours), and even if a second device is used to replace the one with an empty battery, this creates a small but noticeable gap in the recording. Another common source of data loss is connection problems with wireless data streaming. With a Bluetooth connection, the maximum range between the wearable and its companion device is usually 10 m within the same room. Whenever a wearable device is disconnected, it needs to automatically reconnect and transfer any buffered data, otherwise, any data collected while the device is disconnected will be lost. The Empatica E4 device used in the studies included here does not implement such functionality in Bluetooth streaming mode. When this device loses its Bluetooth connection it powers off completely and must be manually restarted for the connection to be re-established, leading to significant data loss. Finally, data gaps can be introduced by human interaction. Taking the device off for a short time, for example, during a shower or neuroimaging causes several minutes of data loss. Incorrect operation of the device can also lead to lost data. Some of these causes for data incompleteness can be avoided, for example, by the careful preparation of a study protocol detailing proper usage of the device. Others are inevitable, and some gaps in the data set are unavoidable. Data coverage was determined in two different categories: the overall data coverage and the number of missed seizures during each patient’s recording. Data coverage is computed by counting the number of samples per modality collected from the wearable device, per patient, and dividing by the number of expected samples given the recording time. This method poten- tially undercounts the data loss because it ignores any loss when the device is not worn. The same methodology is applied to counting missed seizures, that is, only seizures that happened within the start and end of the recording are counted toward the expected amount. Among patients who wore the Empatica E4 device in the UKF and KCL sites, the average data coverage over all participants was 52 % and 40 %, respectively, with the loss of data at- tributed in large part to the live data streaming functionality, but it was also affected by device recharging and the patients bathing during their in-hospital stay. In a different study which specifically and more extensively investigated data and signal quality of wearable device data, the data coverage was reported as 54.2 % and 51.5 % for the same clinical sites UKF and KCL, respectively, including similar patient cohorts and data sets [174]. Figure 3.2 highlights data completeness considerations for a patient in the UKF cohort. Two gaps in the data as well as missing seizures can be seen in this example. The recording for this patient is missing approximately 30 % of its expected data, and 17 of 33 seizures (52 %) were missed as a result. Data quality is an important property for any scientific data set. The quality of data col- lected from wearable devices can be degraded by several issues related to the sensor hardware and application. Any physical sensor has mechanical or electrical imperfections that can pro- duce sensor noise. Imperfections can also be caused by external stimuli introducing an un- wanted variation of the data, a so-called artifact. These artifacts can sometimes be corrected after data collection, but other times completely disrupt the underlying data. A relevant exam- ple is motion artifacts in the photoplethysmography (PPG) data collected from the Empatica E4 device. A PPG sensor works by measuring the light reflection of the skin, which changes 54 CHAPTER 3. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN Figure 3.2: Spectral entropy of the blood volume pulse signal of the E4 device during the recording of a single patient recruited at the UKF site. The signal gives an idea of the quality of the blood volume pulse (BVP) data for HR calculation; low spectral entropy (blue) indicates a higher quality signal with fewer artifacts. The gaps show times when there was a problem with the recording and no BVP signal was present. The green circles mark seizures during which wearable data were recorded; the red squares mark seizures where no data were available. Remaster of Figure 3 in Bruno et al. [103]. with blood volume, that is, with each pulse. However, light from an external source, for exam- ple, sunlight, can compromise the reflective value measured by the photodiode of the sensor. If the device was not tightly fastened around the wrist, the actual BVP data for that segment are not recoverable. This can be a considerable problem for data collection during physical activity or during convulsive seizures. Another source of poor data quality is inaccuracies introduced by the sensor, for example, caused by faulty or deteriorated hardware. To measure data quality, numerous methods can be found in existing literature, and are usually specific to a certain sensor modality [159, 212, 257, 300, 301]. Figure 3.2 shows a plot of the spectral entropy calculated from the Empatica E4’s BVP signal collected from a single patient at the UKF site, as an example of a data quality measure applied to the wearable device recordings. Spectral entropy gives an idea of the quality of the BVP data for HR calculation. Lower values mean the signal is of higher quality, that is, contains fewer artifacts. The signal quality is generally higher overnight when patients rest.","What are some common causes of gaps in data collection, particularly during live data streaming, and how can data dashboards help address these issues?",en,"Some common causes of gaps in data collection during live data streaming include limited battery life of the device, which requires charging time, and connection problems with wireless data streaming. When a device is disconnected due to poor connection or running out of battery, any data collected during that period will be lost. Data dashboards can help address these issues by aggregating data completeness and quality measures in real-time, displaying gaps or inconsistencies with intuitive charts and tables. They also monitor system function and user adherence, which can help identify when a device has been disconnected or charging, allowing for prompt action to ensure uninterrupted data collection.","Common causes of gaps in data collection during live streaming include limited battery life and connection problems. Data dashboards can help monitor system function, user adherence, and identify such gaps with intuitive charts and tables."
"During the daytime, patients tend to be more active, and the signal is prone to movement artifacts, represented by higher values in spectral entropy. Seizure detection evaluation The common goal of most epilepsy-related studies with wearable devices is to achieve robust seizure detection and prediction. Reporting results of evaluations of these methodologies is 3.1. STUDY PROCEDURES 55 an important part of any study and should follow a defined protocol and refer to specific standards [212]. Sensitivity and specificity are the two cornerstones of reporting results of binary classification, especially in a medical context. Sensitivity, also often called recall in a machine learning context, measures the proportion of true positives (TPs) to all expected positive instances. It must always be reported as a study outcome, because for seizure detection it directly describes the respective methodology’s ability to robustly detect seizures from the wearable data. On the other hand, specificity measures the proportion of true negatives to all expected negative instances. To report measures like specificity based on negative instances in the context of wearable seizure detection, the data stream must be segmented into equal- sized portions of either the seizure or non-seizure class. Due to the large data imbalance of these two classes that is usually observed in epilepsy studies, with sometimes multiple days of non-seizure portions in the data interrupted only by often minute-long seizure portions, the specificity measure is artificially boosted to consistently report values of, for example, >98 %, even if there are many false positives (FPs). Because of this lack of informative value, specificity is often omitted when reporting on the performance of a seizure detection system. Instead, the false alarm rate (FAR) or positive predictive value (PPV) can be reported as inverse measures of a seizure detection system’s ability to correctly identify non-seizure periods. The FAR reports the number of false detections over a certain timespan, often chosen as a day (24 h). For example, a FAR of 0.5 per 24 h would mean that the system, on average, produces one false alarm every 2 days. FAR can also be separately reported for daytime and nighttime periods, as false nocturnal alarms may be much more disrupting and less acceptable to patients and caregivers. The PPV, also often called precision in a machine learning context, is the proportion of TPs to all detected positives. It thus gives a measure of the number of FPs to TPs, for example, a PPV of 50 % would describe a result of the same number of FPs as there are TPs. At least one of these measures, FAR and PPV, must always be reported as a study outcome, to properly convey the number of FPs a system is likely to produce. One possible way to counteract false alarms could be to ask patients to perform specific periodic movements like brushing their teeth. These movements, recorded by the wearable, could then be used to adjust a model to be more robust against non-epileptic activities of daily living. To visualize the results of an evaluation of a seizure detection model, or to compare the performance of multiple models, the receiver operating characteristic curve is a widely used and accepted tool. It plots the probability of detection against the probability of false alarm (FP and TP rates) of a binary classifier at varied discrimination thresholds. Thereby, it visualizes the trade-off a model makes between detecting true events and producing false alarms. For all of these measures, there is generally a trade-off between reporting them on a per- patient basis and taking the mean across patients or reporting the overall value over the whole applicable data set. Optimally, both aggregations should be reported in the outcomes of a study, as they often both provide slightly different but equally worthwhile conclusions. 3.1.5 Data Sharing Free and open platforms for sharing data and facilitating collaboration are important research resources. Open databases (from which data can be explored and downloaded), and novel al- gorithms and source code (that can be shared between collaborators) are important tools in neuroscience projects. Different examples can be cited, including openneuro.org, epilepsye- cosystem.org, ieeg.org, and physionet.org. Research teams should be encouraged to share raw 56 CHAPTER 3. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN data and data processing scripts to allow replication and validation of results. Online com- petitions have also been successful at fostering the development of high-performance seizure detection and forecasting algorithms based on intracranial EEG [238, 253, 254], and similar results with wearable data could be expected. Moreover, sharing data, methodologies, and results with partner organizations, like other clinical centers or even device manufacturers, can be greatly beneficial to the advancement not only of the research field of wearable seizure detection in general but also the usability and development of new devices and technologies. This includes the sharing of raw data collected during studies, as well as any scripts and soft- ware used in the processing and scientific analysis of the data, especially concerning seizure detection. To facilitate data sharing, a standardized data format and schema should be adopted to prevent the use of different and potentially not compatible formats. This would promote the replication and validation of results in a collaborative manner and encourage the aggregation of data across research groups. In the long run, giving valuable and constructive feedback on device performance and usability to manufacturers, and sharing these experiences with other organizations, could be a huge boon to possibilities in the treatment of epilepsy, and patients with epilepsy by extension. To accommodate and facilitate the aforementioned sharing of data and experiences, however, a need for open and structured systems and forums exists. Here, clinicians, researchers, developers, manufacturers, as well as patients could collaborate and contribute to the advancement of the treatment of epilepsy with the use of wearable devices. And although strict data protection rules like the EU GDPR may hinder collaboration, these restrictions do not negate the major benefits of sharing pseudonymized or anonymized data for research progress and patient care. 3.2. DATA COLLECTION AND PREPROCESSING 57 3.2 Data Collection and Preprocessing In this section, further details on data collection procedures and data preprocessing are com- piled.","What are the two key metrics (besides sensitivity) that should be reported when evaluating results of binary classification for seizure detection using wearable devices, and why is it important to report them in the context of epilepsy-related studies?",en,"In addition to sensitivity, specificity is another key metric that should be reported when evaluating results of binary classification for seizure detection using wearable devices.

"This section is not part of the publication included in Section 3.1. The device used most prominently in the data collection studies at both clinical centers, the University Medi- cal Center Freiburg and the King’s College Hospital London, and which was selected for the data analysis and evaluation studies included int his thesis, was the Empatica E4 (Empatica Inc., Boston, MA, USA). Section 3.1.2 and Section 3.1.3 already highlight some information on these topics, which is extended here by more technical detail. 3.2.1 Empatica E4 Wearable Device Status LED Button EDA Electrodes PPG Sensor TMP Sensor Data / Charging Figure 3.3: The Empatica E4 wrist-worn wearable device.

Source: empatica.com, own labeling. The Empatica E4 wearable device, developed and manufactured by Empatica Inc., Bos- ton, MA, USA, is a wrist-worn, research-grade monitoring device with a variety of integrated biosignal sensors. It was independently certified by a notified body of the European Union as a Conformité Européenne (CE) class IIa medical device. Figure 3.3 gives a high-level overview of the device and its major components, and Table 3.2 compiles the key technical specifications of the device. The Empatica E4 integrates sensors recording ACC, EDA, PPG, and TMP biosignals. ACC raw data are recorded at a sample rate of 32 Hz with a sensitivity range of −2 g to 2 g. Ranges of ±4 g and ±8 g can be set with custom firmware in agreement with the manufacturer, but this was not done for any of the data collected in the studies included in this thesis. The EDA signals are recorded at a sample rate of 4 Hz with a measurement range of 0.01 µS to 100 µS, using the exosomatic methodology with an alternating current source (see Section 2.2.2). The silver electrodes are integrated into the wristband and placed on the inner wrist. The PPG signals are captured at 64 Hz, with an array of two green and two red LEDs, and two photodiodes. 58 CHAPTER 3.

The device output is BVP data, computed by a proprietary algorithm from both green and red light reflectance values, and given at the same sample rate. Finally, the TMP data are sampled at 4 Hz with a measurement range of −40 ◦C to 115 ◦C. The Empatica E4 supports two data acquisition modes: a local storage recording mode and a Bluetooth streaming mode. The two modes are mutually exclusive; If the device is connected to a Bluetooth device no data will be recorded on the internal storage. In local storage mode, the data are stored on an internal device memory and will be transferred to a Windows or Mac application running on an external computer whenever the E4 is connected to it by Universal Serial Bus cable. The raw data are however not directly accessible at this stage, and are transferred by internet connection to cloud-storage servers operated by the device manufacturer, to be viewed and downloaded via an online data dashboard. Alternatively, the device can be connected via Bluetooth to an app running on a mobile device, which in turn reads previously stored or currently streaming data and uploads them to the same manufacturer-controlled servers. In addition, software development kits (SDKs) are available for the Android and iOS platforms to develop a custom data streaming application. For the realization of the studies such an application was used, avoiding the usage of third- party cloud storage (see Section 3.2.2). While in streaming mode, the Empatica E4 does not employ a data buffer, such that any data that are not transmitted to the companion device will be lost. Furthermore, it does not feature an automatic reconnect functionality, rather powering off once the Bluetooth connection has been severed. In streaming mode, which was used for all the data collection included here, the device has a battery life of up to 24 h, depending on the quality of the battery. The device has one physical button, serving as an on/off/reset switch as well as an event marker button, which was however not used in the data collection procedures. A status LED at the front of the device notifies the user of the current data acquisition mode as well as a low battery, a full internal storage, or other potential issues. The Empatica E4 is rated as IP22 drip-resistant, meaning it can withstand some light water dripping vertically or at a slight angle on the device, but it should not be used, for example, in the shower or submerged in water. 3.2.","What are the specific components and locations on the Empatica E4 wearable device, as mentioned in this section?

As a direct companion to the wearable, an Android device2 was used to run a custom open-source application that connects to the wearable by Bluetooth. Furthermore, a data ingest and pro- cessing infrastructure was deployed on a server machine, handling the data collected and sent by the app via standard wireless network connection. The raw data were then stored on a network-attached storage server in human-readable, comma-separated text files for later pro- cessing and analysis. Figure 3.4 gives an overview of the full data collection pipeline, as also further described in the following. The Android app uses a SDK provided by the manufacturer to connect to the E4, receive new raw data, and decode them from a binary format to appropriate floating-point numbers. The Empatica E4 sends data in batches, which the app receives together with a time stamp per sample that derives from the wearable’s internal real-time clock. This clock is updated to the current time of the Android companion device only at the start of each connection session. The app then collects all of these samples of raw data, grouped by biosignal modality, supplementing each with a secondary time stamp of the Android operating system (OS) time at the moment of receiving. This OS-specific time is regularly synchronized with the internal time of the video-electroencephalography (vEEG) system of the epilepsy monitoring unit. The app then regularly sends the collected data to an ingest-, processing-, and storage server. 1radar-base.org 2UDOO NEO all-in-one mini computer, or Samsung Galaxy Tab A (SM-T580) tablet 60 CHAPTER 3. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN The server application is divided into multiple consecutive parts. A web server handles all incoming requests or data packets (sent over the internet via HTTPS), forwarding them to the correct component. A distributed stream processing platform (Apache Kafka) ingests new data packets on a variety of data topics, that is, it receives data in batches and grouped by biosignal modality, serializes and schematizes that data, and stores it for the short-term. Thereby, it can efficiently handle multiple clients sending data in parallel and in real-time while keeping references to client identifier, biosignal modality, and other metadata, per sample. In a next step, the received and processed data are transferred to a more long-term storage component (Apache Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS)), saving the data on disk and easily accessible to other processes on the server. In order to facilitate data analysis and sharing, in a final step the data are encoded into human-readable comma-separated values files, which can be copied to other computers and easily read into standard data analysis software. 3.2.3 Data Preprocessing All data processing and analysis performed in the studies included in this thesis was done using MATLAB, developed by MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA, USA, in different software versions depending on the most recent release version available at the time. After raw sensor data were collected from study participants, several preprocessing procedures were applied in order to prepare the data for further analysis, for example, feature extraction (see also Section 1.3.3). The specific actions relevant to the analysis performed here were deduplication of data sam- ples, correction of timestamp drift, and discovery of viable data blocks. The timestamps attached to each sample of wearable data, both the native E4 stamp and the Android OS time, are given as Unix time1, that is, the number of seconds elapsed since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. Here, the timestamps are numbers in floating-point for- mat at millisecond precision. The raw Empatica E4 data can sometimes contain two data sam- ples with the exact same timestamp, due to unknown device-internal reasons. Data analysis methodologies generally expect time series data to be unique with respect to sample times- tamps. Thus, immediately after reading the data into memory, samples with the same times- tamp as the one before it were removed. As outlined in Section 3.1.2, inaccuracies in the real-time-clock circuits of wearable de- vices may lead to some differences between the device time and the real time (or vEEG time). The two times may drift apart by several seconds over multiple hours of recording, and the rate of drift is not necessarily linear and not the same for different E4 devices. Furthermore, since the E4 device does not allow a regular automatic synchronization of the internal device time with some external time source, the recorded timestamps needed to be corrected retroac- tively. To this end, the timestamp drift was estimated to be linear over short timespans and between points of greater than normal change in time. The drift itself was calculated by taking the difference between the Empatica E4 and Android OS reference time, which was regularly synchronized with the internal vEEG time. The estimated short-term linear segments of the drift were then subtracted from the same, resulting in new timestamps for each sample that are in line with the reference time, within a margin for error of less than one second. Fig- ure 3.5 gives an example of this procedure for a multi-day Empatica E4 recording, including several disconnects and reconnects showing as jumps of the drift to zero due to the one-time 1Also known as “POSIX time” or “Epoch time” 3.2.

The seizure detection methodologies and machine learning algorithms used in the analysis rely on gap-less data for all included biosignal modalities. However, the Empatica E4 does not reliably provide data from all sensors at all times during the recording. In fact, the raw data set contains several sometimes hour-long periods where data of one modality is present, but not of another. These gaps were furthermore found to always be larger than one second. Thus, to facilitate efficient analysis, gap-less data blocks including full data from all three relevant biosignal modalities (ACC, EDA, BVP) were discovered. To this end, the raw data were traversed in one-second steps, and those parts that did not contain at least one sample from each modality within one second were disregarded. 62 CHAPTER 3. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN 3.3 Summary This chapter highlighted clinical study design principles, data collection procedures, and con- siderations concerning the data quality and performance evaluation. Methodologies with re- spect to feature extraction and seizure detection were distinctive per analysis, and are fur- ther explained in each respective part of the thesis. The data collection studies referenced in this thesis were conducted at two European epilepsy centers, the University Medical Center Freiburg and the King’s College Hospital London. Study aims for wearable device studies in epilepsy inform aspects like patient selection, choice of device, and data analysis. Specifically, the seizure types targeted for detection are the decisive element. For example, seizure types that do not predominantly include movement of the limbs as a symptom may require different biosignal sensors to collect meaningful data for seizure detection, as compared to convulsive seizures. Here, convulsive tonic-clonic seizures and focal seizures with motor components were the target of seizure detection, and as such the Empatica E4 wearable device was considered to be the best choice. Furthermore, patients with known motor seizures of any kind were included as participants in the studies, whereas patients with a history of only non-motor semiologies were not included in the subsequent data analyses. The Empatica E4 is a research-grade wrist-worn wearable certified as a medical device for epilepsy monitoring, and provides access to the raw data of the biosignal modalities ac- celerometry, electrodermal activity, and blood volume pulse (BVP), which were used in the seizure detection methodologies presented here. Study participants also underwent video-e- lectroencephalography (vEEG) monitoring at the two epilepsy centers the studies were con- ducted at. Epileptologists created expert annotations of seizure onset and offset times as well as type and included semiologies, serving as a ground truth for the evaluation of the seizure detection algorithms. The wearable data were collected via an open-source Android appli- cation and server infrastructure, with the E4 device streaming data via Bluetooth. The raw data time series were synchronized to the vEEG data in a preprocessing step, among other preparing procedures like deduplication and viable data block discovery. Several aspects with respect to the effective reporting of evaluation results were also in- troduced. The data and signal quality provided by the data collection procedures are relevant. Hardware and firmware constraints of the wearable device, along with the data streaming col- lection mode, resulted in a substantial loss of data samples for most study participants. Fur- thermore, the signal quality of especially the BVP data is heavily impacted by motion artifacts, which needs to be kept in mind for those analyses utilizing this signal. To evaluate seizure detection methodologies, several established metrics were introduced enabling gauging of the performance of a detector, as well as comparing it to other detectors. The sensitivity of a detector measures how many events were correctly classified out of all true events. The false alarm rate gives an estimate of how many false detections a model would make per a span of time. The positive predictive value is the proportion of true detections to all detections, informing about the relative amount of false alarms.

DETECTION OF MAJOR CONVULSIVE SEIZURES C onvulsive tonic-clonic seizures, while not the most predominant seizure type among patients with epilepsy in terms of incidence and prevalence, are among the most dan- gerous, and also widely known, seizures that can occur. With regard to automatic seizure detection with wearables, early warning, alarm, and automated diary systems are all relevant in some way. This thesis, however, focuses primarily on the context of seizure diaries. Both generalized tonic-clonic seizures and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures are included in the studies presented here, considered to be reasonably straightforward to detect with data from wearable biosignal sensors. The first part of this chapter includes a study centered around the assessment of a con- vulsive seizure detection methodology, employing features from accelerometry (ACC) and electrodermal activity biosignal data and a boosting ensemble machine learning model. The evaluation shows that the technique performs at least as good as some of the current best published detection systems in similar contexts. The second part of the chapter examines the possibility to use wearables to detect and monitor post-ictal immobility, a state of unconsciousness and no movement that often occurs after patients have had a convulsive seizure and can foreshadow sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). A simple heuristic approach based on ACC data can robustly detect this period in a data set of convulsive seizures recorded in the hospital. The detection of post-ictal immobility highlighted in the second part is specifically de- pendent on prior knowledge of a seizure, and thus would need to be joined with an automatic seizure detection in order to be used in a real-world alarm system for heightened susceptibility to SUDEP. While the detection methodology presented in the first section is not immediately compatible, it could potentially be adapted for this purpose, which is further explored and discussed in the summary of this chapter. 4.1.

Own Contributions: • All, except clinical expertise and the data collection at the KCL site 4.1.1 Introduction Background Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurological diseases, with a reported yearly worldwide incidence of more than 60 per 100,000 individuals [15]. Epilepsy also has a remark- ably diverse set of indications, with several different types of symptoms and characteristic seizures of varying severity. Seizures are usually distinguished by their onset in the brain, focal or generalized. They can involve a variety of different combinations of symptoms, including impaired awareness or loss of consciousness; cognitive, emotional, or sensory abnormalities; sudden changes in the autonomic nervous system; or motor manifestations such as spasms, automatisms, or tonic and clonic movements of the limbs [27]. These convulsive seizures, par- ticularly focal to bilateral or generalized tonic-clonic seizures (TCSs), are the most dangerous type of epileptic seizures. They imply loss of consciousness and loss of motor control with considerable risk for physical harm and can transition to life-threatening status epilepticus or sudden unexpected death in epilepsy [303]. For the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy, clinicians rely on patient self-reporting and structured diaries, counting the number of seizures a patient had in a certain time frame. However, personal diaries filled out by the patients themselves have been proven to be very unreliable, with frequent undercounting because of a lack of awareness of seizures [54, 304]. An objective seizure diary is therefore needed to obtain valid data on seizure occurrence, con- tributing to improved guidance for the treatment of people with epilepsy. Wearable non-elec- troencephalography (EEG) devices (wearables) could provide data for such a diary. They are discreet and unobtrusive, contrary to many wearable EEG devices that are often cumbersome and stigmatizing [305], although some less obtrusive wearable EEG systems are in develop- ment [119, 306]. Moreover, a robust detection of convulsive seizures with wearables, paired with identification of seizure-related risk factors [105], could be of great clinical importance and provide essential information for the identification of seizure-related sudden unexpected death in epilepsy risk factors. Although seizure detection with non-EEG wearables is a relatively new field in epilepsy research, there have already been some studies that have demonstrated the viability of this 66 CHAPTER 4. DETECTION OF MAJOR CONVULSIVE SEIZURES kind of system. To date, most studies have concentrated on a single biosignal modality for training a seizure detection model, with a minority using a multimodal approach [106, 295]. Objective In this study, an automatic seizure detection system for TCSs is presented, using supervised machine learning that is straightforward to implement and reproduce. The detection model is evaluated on a newly recorded data set from a multicenter clinical study with wearable non- EEG devices. Finally, the detection system, its performance, and its limitations are discussed and an outlook of possible further applications for this detection approach are concluded. 4.1.2 Methods Data Set During the course of the study, between July 2017 and February 2020, studies collected wear- able device data from 243 patients diagnosed with epilepsy: 70.7 % (172/243) of patients were recruited at the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) of the University Medical Center Freiburg, and 29.2 % (71/243) of patients were recruited at the EMU in the neurophysiological department of the King’s College Hospital London. Patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy in the age range of 7 to 80 years were recruited, unless they had vigorous involuntary non-epileptic movements.","What is the main focus of this chapter in the thesis and which types of seizures are included in the studies presented, that can be reasonably straightforward to detect using data from wearable biosignal sensors?",en,Le chapitre principal de cette thèse porte sur la détection des convulsions tonico-cloniques majeures.

Studies present detection methods for generalized tonic-clonic and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, which can be reasonably straightforward with wearable biosignal data."
"Consecutive patients were admitted to their respective EMU as part of their standard epilepsy clinical care, for differential diagnosis or for presurgical evaluation, and may have had their antiepileptic medication reduced during the recording. All patients were continuously moni- tored via a video-electroencephalography (vEEG) system during their stay in the EMU. Clinical experts manually reviewed the video and EEG data for all participants and labeled type, onset, and offset for all seizures. Specifically, they also labeled the onset and termination of every motor manifestation, including the tonic and clonic phases of each seizure. These labels were then used as the ground truth in the training and testing phases of the evaluation. Participants wore a variety of different wearable devices across the 2 sites. However, the only device worn by participants from both sites was the Empatica E4 (Section 3.2.1; Empatica Inc., Boston, MA, USA). Owing to battery limitations, each participant was assigned 2 devices, between which they changed twice daily to ensure continuous recordings. The wearable de- vice recorded 3-axis accelerometry (ACC) at a sample rate of 32 Hz, electrodermal activity (EDA) at 4 Hz, and photoplethysmography (PPG) at 64 Hz, which was processed on the device to a blood volume pulse signal. Participants generally wore the device on the arm that was most involved in motor semiology during seizures, that is, the arm that presented the most substantial movements. In the set of 10 participants with TCSs included here, each wore the device on their non-dominant hand, except for 2 participants included in this study who spec- ified that they were ambidextrous. The study and recording procedures are further described in Chapter 3. All recruited patients provided written informed consent, and the study procedures were approved by the ethics committee at the University of Freiburg (538/16) and the London Ful- ham Research Ethics Committee (16/LO/2209; Integrated Research Application System project ID216316). 4.1. DETECTION OF TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURES 67 Features An extensive feature set was created from the ACC and EDA signals, encompassing 141 ACC and 10 EDA features, at sliding window sizes of 2, 10, and 20 seconds for the ACC features, and 5, 10, and 20 minutes for the EDA features. PPG signals were not analyzed in this study because of major ictal movement artifacts resulting from the convulsive TCSs. Although ar- tifacts in PPG data can still convey information, in that the presence of noise itself can be information, the choice was made to omit it here in favor of focusing on the other 2 biosig- nals, because the information of PPG motion artifacts is naturally included in the ACC signal as well. The ACC features included a variety of different time and frequency domain features. The EDA features represented the skin conductance level (SCL), that is, tonic low-frequency EDA changes, and skin conductance response rate (SCRR), that is, phasic or higher-frequency EDA changes, calculated against a baseline. As detection models usually perform most effectively with smaller feature sets, both in terms of computational cost and prediction performance [307], the number of used features was reduced considerably. For this feature selection, related literature in the field of wearable seizure detection was consulted to narrow down window sizes that effectively capture rele- vant signal changes in time and identify feature types that were successfully used previously. Thereby, a window of 10 seconds for the ACC features was selected [214, 215, 224], and a longer window of 5 minutes for the EDA features to capture the tonic changes in the EDA signal that evolve over longer periods [153]. The feature data were then visualized in a period around the seizure, overlaid over each other, and for all features separately. In addition, the mean and standard deviation (SD) for each data series was plotted. The data that were used for these graphs were taken only from the seizures of participants that were not included in the test set to be used in the out-of-sample performance evaluation (see Section 4.1.3). Fea- tures showing recurrent typical ictal changes were then visually selected for further analysis (Figure 4.1). Variable seizure durations were handled by upsampling shorter seizures by linear interpolation to the length of the longest seizure among those plotted. The resulting feature subset for the ACC modality consisted of the magnitude, zero cross- ing rate, and recurrence plot features (Figure 4.1) [308]. For the EDA features, the area under the curve and the maximum of the SCL within the window, and the SCRR were chosen, all corrected against a baseline, which is an interval of the same duration as the feature window, ending immediately before the beginning of the feature window. Thus, the resulting feature set can be divided into 4 main feature groups: 1. Magnitude of the ACC signal (ACC = p x2 + y2 + z2): (a) Raw ACC signal, over a 10 s window. (b) Band pass filtered ACC signal over a 10 s window. The band pass filter had a fre- quency band of 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz, representing the linear component of the ACC signal, and was applied before segmentation into windows. (c) Low-pass filtered ACC signal over a 10 s window. The low-pass filter had a cutoff frequency of 1 Hz, thus preserving only the gravitational component of the ACC signal, and was applied before segmentation into windows. 2. Zero crossing rate of the ACC signal over a 10 s window, for each of the 3 axes, respec- tively. The zero crossing rate is the number of times in a certain period the signal crosses the value 0 over the same period. 68 CHAPTER 4.","What type and specific role does the Empatica E4 device play in monitoring patients across two sites for their epilepsy clinical care, and why are there battery limitations associated with this device?",en,"The Empatica E4 device plays a crucial role as a wearable device used for continuous monitoring of patients across two sites during their epilepsy clinical care. Specifically, it records three types of physiological signals: 3-axis accelerometry (ACC), electrodermal activity (EDA), and photoplethysmography (PPG). The PPG signal is processed on the device to a blood volume pulse signal. This data is used for analysis during seizures, with patients typically wearing the device on the arm most involved in motor semiology (movements) during these episodes.

The battery limitations associated with this device are likely due to the high sample rates at which it records these physiological signals: 32 Hz for accelerometry, 4 Hz for electrodermal activity, and 64 Hz for photoplethysmography. These high sampling frequencies require significant power, necessitating regular battery changes to ensure continuous recordings.","The Empatica E4 device monitors patients across two sites for epilepsy clinical care, recording 3-axis accelerometry, electrodermal activity, and photoplethysmography. Battery limitations are associated with this device due to the need for continuous recordings."

DETECTION OF TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURES 69 (c) The SCRR was calculated as the number of threshold crossings of the first deriva- tive of the smoothed EDA signal within the window. To accommodate the different window sizes over which the ACC and EDA features are cal- culated, a fixed interval between feature window applications was applied. Thus, all features are calculated at fixed time points, with their respective windows centered on each consecu- tive point, creating the same number of feature vectors for both the ACC and EDA features over a segment of data. This enables the use of the complete, merged feature space as the sin- gle input into a detection model for training [106]. The interval between the fixed time points for feature calculation was chosen to be 2 seconds. Figure 5.2 and Figure 5.5 give a graphical representation of the feature computation methodology. Seizure Detection A gradient boosted decision trees (GBT) model [309] was used as the detection model for the TCSs. Although similar to the well-known random forest (RF) method in being a set of trees that are grown with training data, a GBT model builds trees as weak learners in an additive manner. The model is improved with each new weak learner that is added to the ensemble, whereas the RF model trains all trees in parallel and independent of each other. Weak learners in this case are trees with a very low number of splits, down to decision stumps with just 1 split. This results in an overall lower bias and similar variance for GBT models compared with RF models at the cost of higher parameter tuning effort. Therefore, GBT models generally perform better than RF models if tuned sufficiently, and they have been successfully used in machine learning problems [95]. To tackle this tuning effort, a hyperparameter optimization was performed over several of the model parameters in a leave-one-participant-out (LOPO) manner. To this end, the data set was split into a training set and a test set. The training set consisted of the 10 min peri-ictal data of 10 TCSs from 8 patients with epilepsy recruited at the Freiburg site. The basic test set consisted of the complete data from 2 patients, 1 from the Freiburg site and 1 from the London site with 11 TCSs (see Section 4.1.3). The hyperparameter optimization only used the training set to keep the test set unknown to the model before testing. All feature data were normalized between −1 and 1 before training and testing. For training, the combined feature input for the model, that is, the peri-ictal feature data of 10 TCSs, were normalized, and for testing the complete feature data from the recordings for a participant were normalized independent of the feature data of the other participants in the test set. The hyperparameter optimization was performed in a LOPO nested cross-validation man- ner on the training set. The data for 1 of the 8 participants in the training set were kept back as a validation set, and the model was trained on the seizures from the other 7 participants, using only 10 min peri-ictal data for each seizure. This reduction of the training data to only a small period around seizures helps with the large imbalance in the data set when comparing ictal and non-ictal epochs. Once the model was trained, it was then tested on the complete data of the validation participant in the respective round, and the process was repeated 7 more times, cycling through the participants for validation. The mean score of the 8 validation runs was then saved as the performance of the current parameter combination, and the entire val- idation process was repeated for the next parameter combination. The parameters that were tuned in the optimization and their divisions are listed in Table 4.1, with the resulting optimal 70 CHAPTER 4.

In total, 720 parameter combinations were evaluated in the hyperparameter optimization process. Furthermore, the GBT model also had some fixed parameters that were the same for all optimization runs. The boosting method used in the model was adaptive boosting for binary classification [310], and the misclassification cost for false negatives was always 1. The hy- perparameter optimization resulted in an optimal set of parameters that were subsequently used in all the testing steps. The optimal parameter combination was chosen as the combina- tion that achieved the highest sensitivity and lowest false alarm rate (FAR) during the LOPO validation run of the parameter combination, prioritizing sensitivity. Model parameters not specified here were left at their default values. Evaluation To process the model output and score its performance when compared with the ground truth, the same method was used both in the validation during hyperparameter optimization and later during the testing phase (see Section 4.1.3). Owing to the method of feature extraction at fixed time intervals of 2 seconds, the output of the GBT model is a prediction vector con- taining the predicted label every 2 seconds. The input labels, that is, the ground truth, and the predicted labels were binary, denoting the classification of each 2-second interval to either be- long to a seizure or not. Comparing the ground truth and the prediction labels for evaluation can be done sample-wise by comparing each 2-second interval, or event-wise, by combining consecutive intervals of the positive class to distinct events. In this analysis the latter method was chosen, which requires postprocessing of the model output. 4.1. DETECTION OF TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURES 71 First, the prediction output of the model was smoothed with a hysteresis-like filter to avoid single-sample positives or gaps in consecutive positive predictions. To this end, all gaps be- tween consecutive positive predictions smaller than 20 seconds in duration were filled out as positive, thus creating continuous, longer events from short neighboring positive predictions. Thereafter, all consecutive positive predictions of a certain length were discarded. This value was chosen to be 4 seconds, as it provides a good balance between discarding short, single- sample predictions and still keeping possible relevant events. Thus, the prediction output of the model can be matched to the ground truth per participant by counting overlaps of pre- dicted positive events with a positive ground truth event as true positives (TPs) and predicted positive events with no overlaps in the ground truth as false positives (FPs). The number of false negatives is then the difference between TPs and the number of seizures a participant recorded. The number of true negatives was not considered for this evaluation, as the sensi- tivity and FAR are sufficient to evaluate a methodology for seizure detection. Unless otherwise stated, the reported sensitivity Sens = TP TP+FN and FAR = FP·24 hours rec are calculated across all relevant participants as a whole, not the mean over single participants. All calculations for signal processing, feature extraction, and model development and eval- uation were performed using MATLAB 2020a (MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA, USA). 4.1.3 Results Overview For the study presented here, only study participants with focal to bilateral or generalized TCSs were included. This resulted in a data set of 21 TCSs from 10 participants, 9 from the Freiburg site with 19 seizures captured, and 1 from the London site with 2 seizures captured. The mean length of convulsive motor phenomena was 64 (SD 23) seconds. Table 4.2 lists the clinical and demographic information of the participants. They were 40 % (4/10) female and on average 32.7 (SD 11.2) years old. The etiology of epilepsy for 2 participants was unknown at the time of recruitment. A total of 1 participant was diagnosed with generalized epilepsy, and the other 9 were diagnosed with focal epilepsy. For all captured seizures, wearable device data for at least 30 min before and after the ictal period were recorded in good quality; that is, the recorded data showed no major artifacts or intervals with constant 0 amplitude on visual inspection. A total of 612.6 h of data were recorded for the included participants with seizures. Cross-validation Training The training set used for hyperparameter optimization included 10 seizures from 8 partici- pants and covered 414.7 h of wearable device data. With the best parameter combination, as described above, the LOPO cross-validation could detect all 10 seizures (sensitivity = 100 %) with a total of 8 FPs (FAR = 0.46 per 24 h). The FP rate was calculated as the ratio of total FPs across all participants to the number of hours of recordings multiplied by 24, and not the mean FAR across participants. In the training set LOPO cross-validation, 75 % (6/8) of FPs were produced from the data of 1 participant and 2 by another. Thus, the other 6 participants were free of FPs. All 8 FPs detected by the model during the LOPO cross-validation occurred when the patient was off camera, for example, in the morning or evening when they were in the bathroom for their daily washing routine. 72 CHAPTER 4.

Out-of-Sample Testing The model was also tested using a previously unseen test set from the overall data set. This test set included 11 seizures from 2 participants, 1 from the London site with 2 seizures recorded, and the other from the Freiburg site with 9 seizures recorded, for a total of 197.9 h of test data. The choice of training and test set was deliberate: With the relatively low number of seizures and their distribution among participants in this data set, the goal was to train on as many participants as possible while also having approximately the same number of seizures in the test set. This allocation ensures a model that is not patient specific while keeping the training and test sets balanced in terms of the number of seizures. The GBT model with the optimal parameters and trained with all 10 seizures from the training set could detect 10 of the 11 seizures in this test set (sensitivity = 91 %), without any FPs. However, this test set was limited in that it was biased towards participants who had convulsive seizures. Therefore, the test set was expanded to also include data from all 30 patients with epilepsy recruited at the London site that had data recorded with the wearable device. Although this does not add more seizures to the test set for the model to detect, it does add a considerable amount of data, improving the assessment with respect to the FP rate. The expanded test set thus encompasses 1935.9 h of wearable device data from 31 participants, including the same 11 seizures as before. In this data set, the same model produces 30 FPs (0.37 per 24 h). Further investigation of the FP distribution among the participants showed that 15 false detections resulted from a single participant who used a stepper during monitoring as physical activity to trigger her seizures. All FPs for that participant were related to this activity. Removing this participant, performing unnatural repetitive movements, from the expanded test set lowers the FP rate to 0.19 per 24 h. Of the other participants in this expanded test set, the data of 2 participants produced 3 FPs, respectively, whereas 9 other participants each 4.1.

Thus, the FAR, when calculated as the mean across all the included participants’ individual FARs, was 0.45 (SD 1.1) per 24 h, and 0.29 (SD 0.53) per 24 h when excluding the participant with 15 FP. Table 4.3 provides a detailed overview of the results among the participants with recorded seizures. Seizure Duration The duration of detected seizures was significantly correlated with the vEEG-based seizure duration, as labeled by clinical experts (Figure 4.2). The true seizure duration here is based on its clinical manifestation, that is, onset until offset of ictal motor phenomena related to TCSs. In a Pearson correlation test, the correlation coefficient was r = 0.55, with P = 0.01. In general, the seizure duration was underestimated by the model by approximately half of the true duration, with a mean identified duration of 29 (SD 15) seconds versus the mean seizure duration of 64 (SD 23) seconds. This may be reflective of the less severe movement amplitudes during the tonic phases of the TCSs. Feature Importance Furthermore, the feature importance for the feature set was analyzed as a metric for the con- tribution of a specific feature to the performance of the model. It was calculated as the mean 74 CHAPTER 4.

The total duration of test data was approximately 197.9 hours. This performance evaluation was deliberate to train on as many participants as possible while having an approximately equal number of seizures in the test set. This allocation ensures a model that is not patient-specific, while keeping the training and test sets balanced in terms of the number of seizures. However, specific numerical accuracy or error rates are not provided in the text.","The model performed on a previously unseen test set, including 197.9 hours of data from 2 participants."

The identity line shows that the seizure duration is generally underestimated by the model. feature importance over all trained GBT models in the LOPO cross-validation (Figure 4.3). The feature importance was based on the Gini impurity, calculated such that the smallest possible value was 0 [311]. Overall, all 4 feature groups, as described in the Features section, are repre- sented in the resulting GBT model to varying degrees of importance. The top 3 features among the feature set were that the Shannon entropy of the probability that a line in the recurrence plot had a certain length calculated over a 10 s window of the ACC signal, the magnitude of the band pass filtered ACC signal in a 10 s window, and the maximum of the SCL in a 5 min window of the EDA signal, corrected for a baseline. 4.1.4 Discussion Principal Findings The results show that the GBT model can robustly detect TCSs from non-EEG wearable device data. A sensitivity of 100 % (10/10) on the training set during a LOPO cross-validation, a sensitivity of 91 % (10/11) on the out-of-sample test set, and a FAR of less than 1 per 5 days in more than 1800 h of data indicates a sufficient robustness of this methodology to consider it in designing an automated seizure diary. A large percentage of FPs occurred in a small percentage of participants, with most other participants showing between 0 and 0.5 FPs per day. Furthermore, in participants of the test set who had TCSs, no FPs were reported by the model. In addition, all true detections of the model occurred within the ictal period of the respective seizure, showing that the system has high accuracy. Evaluating a test set that includes data largely from 1 site (London), while the model was trained exclusively with data from the other site (Freiburg), shows the generalizability of the model. Although the data set contains continuous circadian data, most TCSs occurred during nighttime sleep. In the training set, 50 % (5/10) of seizures occurred while the patient was 4.1.

All the features are shown as listed in the Features section (1: magnitude of accelerometry, 2: zero crossing rate of accelerometry, 3: recurrence plot features of accelerometry, and 4: electrodermal activity features). The feature importance is shown in logarithmic scale to better visualize smaller dif- ferences. awake, and in the test set, only 9 % (1/11) occurred during wakefulness. Of these 6 awake seizures, 2 seizures occurred when the patient was outside the bed. All TP detections, both in the training set LOPO cross-validation and in the test set evaluation, occurred within the ictal phase of the respective seizure. Conversely, all FP detections occurred when the patient was awake and active, and most of them occurred during daytime. Patients were generally not confined to their beds but rather to their hospital rooms. They could freely perform a variety of activities of daily living, such as strolling across the room, going to the bathroom, brushing their teeth, eating and drinking, and washing themselves. Movement patterns during these activities, particularly if repetitive, could resemble those during convulsive seizures and may be a common source of FP detections. However, false alarms during these activities when the patient is awake could be ignored easily by way of patient validation and feedback to avoid inappropriate interventions. 76 CHAPTER 4.

The raw ACC signal is shown at the top, and the raw EDA signal as well as the best EDA feature (Section Features, Feature 4b) at the bottom; all are normalized between −1 and 1, independent of each other. The ictal tonic-clonic phase is overlaid in red, the true positive detection is overlaid in green. Feature Importance The distribution of feature contribution to the performance of the model shows that all se- lected features are used by the model to predict a seizure event, except for one, the recurrence rate in the recurrence plot of the ACC signal. The least amount of importance is assigned to the magnitude of the low-pass filtered ACC signal. This is an expected outcome, as this feature represents the gravitational component of the movement, which is minimal during convulsive seizures. During these seizures, almost all movements are part of the linear component, rep- resented by the band pass filtered signal, which is also confirmed by this feature being one of the most important in the model. Among the EDA-derived features, the highest importance was consistently assigned to the difference between the highest value in the feature and the baseline windows of the SCL. A typical EDA signal progression in the peri-ictal period is a steep increase from a low pre-ictal baseline during the ictal phase, followed by a shallow decrease in the post-ictal phase, spanning multiple minutes. Thus, the feature based on the difference of the highest value between pre- ictal, ictal, and post-ictal phases can sufficiently represent this trend, as evidenced by its high importance. Figure 4.4 shows the EDA signal progression and the respective maximum SCL feature during a seizure. The feature values are at their highest during the ictal phase, whereas the raw EDA signal shows the typical progression described above. False Negatives There was 1 seizure the model did not detect among the training and testing data sets (Fig- ure 4.5). This false negative was produced by one of the participants recruited at the London site, and the seizure occurred during the night when the patient was asleep. The other seizure recorded for this participant was successfully detected by the model.","What are the top three most important features in the resulting Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT) model, as determined by the Shannon entropy, band pass filtered Acceleration signal, and maximum of the SCL in a 5-minute window of the EDA signal?",en,"The top three most important features in the resulting Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT) model are:
1. Shannon entropy of the probability that a line in the recurrence plot had a certain length calculated over a 10-second window of the ACC signal,

"The raw data before and after the seizure can shed light on why the seizure was rejected by the model, specifically look- ing at the ACC response during the seizure, and the EDA trend going from the pre- to post-ictal 4.1.

Note the differences in the EDA signal progression in comparison to Figure 4.4, which shows a typical response.

The ictal tonic-clonic phase is overlaid in red. phase. The motion response in the ictal phase of the rejected seizure was a typical progression from a short tonic phase at the beginning of the seizure to a longer, very pronounced, and violent clonic phase, stopping promptly with the seizure offset, followed by a short phase of post-ictal ACC silence. The raw EDA signal, however, follows a progression directly opposite to the signals from all other TCSs in the data set. The signal shows a steep decrease from a high baseline during the ictal phase and remains at a lower level in the post-ictal phase com- pared with the baseline in the pre-ictal phase. Figures 4.4 and 4.5 show the comparison of data from the 2 recorded seizures from participant LO1, with the detected seizure being represen- tative of all other TCSs in the data set, especially those in the training set that created the model. Both seizures showed similar ACC data and a similar change in the ACC-based feature values. However, the EDA data and feature values were visibly opposite. This confirms that the model was trained properly on both the ACC and EDA features and that both modalities contributed to the model’s classification of seizure occurrence. Thus, the misclassification of 1 event was due to atypical raw data and confirmed that the model included EDA features in its classification. A possible explanation for the unusual EDA signal during this seizure could be that the EDA electrodes lost adequate contact with the skin, and it was not fully re-established after the seizure. This could be caused by an improperly worn wearable device, or a loss of contact owing to the wearable device coming into contact with an external obstacle such as being pressed into the bed, slightly raising the EDA electrodes off the skin. Related Work The research that is most closely related to the premise of this study is certainly that of Onorati et al. [224]. In their work, the Empatica research group developed a seizure detection model based on wearable data from the same device used in this study, Empatica E4. They used a support vector machine trained with 25 ACC as well as EDA features that were not further 78 CHAPTER 4. DETECTION OF MAJOR CONVULSIVE SEIZURES specified to detect convulsive seizures and achieve a very good performance, with their best classifier reaching a sensitivity of 94.5 % and a FAR of 0.2 per day on 55 seizures from 22 patients. The work presented here is on par with their results and reinforces their findings. It is shown that results of this quality can be achieved with a relatively basic methodology, which is described in greater detail here, making it fully accessible and reproducible. The methodology may even be transferrable to other diseases with convulsive attacks, such as paroxysmal dystonia1 or psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Thus, the study described here could be used as a stepping-stone for further work not only in epilepsy research but also in other medical fields. In a further study, Kusmakar et al. [215] used a monomodal support vector data description model on wearable ACC data to detect 21 generalized TCSs from 12 patients, with a total recording length of 966 h. The outlier classification model could achieve a sensitivity of 95 % in a LOPO cross-validation, with a mean FAR of 0.72 per day. However, their model generated FP detections across almost all of the 12 included patients, showing a general trend toward FP detections independent of patient selection, whereas the model evaluated here could achieve a generally lower FP rate on both the training and test sets, also revealing certain patients with a disproportionate FAR. Arends et al. [226] used the LivAssured NightWatch wearable device in a large ambulatory long-term monitoring study, collecting 908 convulsive seizures from 28 patients over more than 1800 nights. The device collects ACC and PPG signals from the patients’ upper arm, specifically during the night. Their thresholding algorithm could detect 86 % of the recorded seizures, with a positive predictive value of 49 %, indicating that roughly half of all predic- tions were FPs. Although the methodology introduced here produces slightly worse results with respect to the overall FAR, the studies differ in that the NightWatch study only assessed nocturnal data with patients at rest, whereas the assessment presented here, based on contin- uous data comprising wakefulness and sleep, showed the model’s ability to correctly detect daytime seizures; notably, all the FPs were generated while the respective patient was awake and active. In a more recent study, Johansson et al. [214] used wrist-worn ACC sensors to detect 37 TCSs from 11 patients with 666 h of data. They evaluated 3 different types of models on a test set of 10 seizures and obtained the best result using a RF algorithm, detecting 9 of 10 seizures with a FAR of 0.24 per day. However, the evaluation of FPs is constrained to patients with TCSs, introducing a certain bias in patient selection. In this evaluation, a control group of up to 29 participants without TCSs recorded was added, with the model achieving a similar FAR, while also only producing FPs on these participants without seizures, whereas the participants with TCSs had no false alarms.","Why did the model fail to detect the tonic-clonic seizure of participant LO1 in Figure 4.5, despite a typical motion response during the ictal phase, and what specific differences can be observed in the EDA signal progression compared to a typical response (as shown in Figure 4.4)?",en,"The model failed to detect the tonic-clonic seizure of participant LO1 in Figure 4.5 due to unusual differences in the EDA signal progression compared to a typical response, as shown in Figure 4.4. While the motion response during the ictal phase was typical, featuring a short tonic phase followed by a longer and violent clonic phase, the raw EDA signal showed a steep decrease from a high baseline during the ictal phase and remained at a lower level in the post-ictal phase compared to the baseline in the pre-ictal phase. This opposite progression of the EDA signal is unlike the expected pattern observed in other TCSs in the data set, which could have caused the model to miss this seizure.","The model failed to detect the tonic-clonic seizure of participant LO1 due to atypical EDA signal progression during the ictal phase, which decreased steeply instead of increasing like in typical responses."
"Limitations The methodology for TCS detection described here also introduces some limitations, one of which is the long feature window used for the EDA feature computation. A 5 min long window enabled the inclusion of tonic changes in the EDA signal spanning over multiple minutes in the post-ictal phase. However, this automatically introduces an inherent detection delay, as a real-time system would need to first collect these data before being able to extract the 1A neurological hyperkinetic movement disorder causing sudden pain, tremors, or abnormal movements of the body, limbs, or face 4.1. DETECTION OF TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURES 79 EDA features and detect a potential seizure. Thus, this methodology would not be suited as a real-time warning system. Another limitation is the constraint of the model to detect only TCSs. As the model training process relies on data from the accelerometer sensor, non- motor seizures cannot be detected with this set of modalities and features. Future work will be needed to assess the contribution of the PPG and EDA sensors in detecting non-motor seizures. Furthermore, the performance of the specific model trained here is likely not sufficient to be deployed directly as an automatic seizure diary, especially considering its constraint on TCSs, which can be infrequent in everyday life. Additional work and more training data would be needed to create a system that is usable in clinical practice, possibly even shifting to a semi- personalized model that can be reinforced over time by patient feedback. One of the most prevalent limitations in many studies in this field is the controlled in- hospital setting in which wearable device data are collected. Although patients in this study were able to perform some activities of daily living in and around their bed and were able to walk within their hospital room, the likelihood of false positive generation can be assumed to be higher in an outpatient setting. False alarms during physical activity could be addressed by actively involving the patient through validation and feedback, for example, by giving them a chance to review seizure diary entries. Nevertheless, transferring this methodology to an ambulatory setting will require extensive modifications and reevaluation with data recorded in everyday living situations that include a gold standard for seizure labeling. In any case, a robust classifier that has a likelihood of working in the field must first be validated in an inpatient setting to progress to an ambulatory study, and the research presented here takes a clear step in that direction. 80 CHAPTER 4.

Own Contributions: • Contribution to methods (4.2.2) • Wearable device data analysis (4.2.2) • Contribution to description of results (4.2.3) • Contribution to discussion (4.2.4) 4.2.1 Introduction Movement analysis based on accelerometry (ACC) signals has shown an overall good perfor- mance for the detection of convulsive seizures (generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs) and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (FBTCSs)) in epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs) [312– 315] and, to a lesser extent, in real-life settings [298]. A potential application of movement sen- sors may also be the identification of the diametrically opposite feature: the absence of motion. Immediately following a seizure, this phenomenon represents an interesting clinical manifes- tation, known as post-ictal immobility (PI). PI has been recognized by clinicians for more than a century [316], although the pathophysiological1 mechanism has remained largely unclear. Frequently observed after convulsive seizures, PI has been associated with potentially life- threatening complications and with sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) [317]. In addition, PI has often been observed in association with post-ictal generalized electroenceph- alography suppression (PGES) [318–322], an electroencephalography (EEG) pattern recorded in SUDEP cases [303, 323–329]. The identification of PI through wearables has not yet been adequately explored. Because most convulsive seizures do not lead to SUDEP and the occurrence of a fatal seizure is un- predictable, the automatic, continuous, long-term identification of risk factors for SUDEP as- sociated with each individual seizure assumes great clinical importance. In a population at high risk of SUDEP, this study aims to assess whether ACC could be used as a reliable digital marker of PI and of its duration after convulsive seizures. In addition, the association of post- ictal ACC silence with PGES, and with other physiological and clinical variables associated with SUDEP, was investigated. 1Functional changes occurring due to a disease 4.2. POTENTIAL USE OF TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE DETECTION 81 4.2.2 Methods Study Participants Like the other studies included in this thesis, this study was developed in the context of “Re- mote Assessment of Disease and Relapse – Epilepsy”, a multicenter study designed to assess the clinical utility of multi-parametric remote measurement technologies in a clinical popu- lation with epilepsy, in the hospital and real-world environment [291]. The study population consisted of consecutive patients with epilepsy (PWEs) who were admitted, for diagnostic rea- sons or presurgical evaluation, to the EMU at either the neurophysiology department at King’s College Hospital London, or the Epilepsy Center at the University Medical Center Freiburg. Participants presenting with convulsive seizures (GTCSs or FBTCSs) were included. Ethics Approval The trial and study procedures were approved by the London Fulham Research Ethics Com- mittee (16/LO/2209; IRAS project ID216316) and in Freiburg by the Ethics Committee at the University of Freiburg (538/16). All participants provided written informed consent. Recordings and Data Collection Measurements: Participants were asked to wear a wrist-worn multimodal device (Empatica E4, Figure 4.6a; Section 3.2.1; Empatica Inc., Boston, MA, USA) at both sites for the entire du- ration of their stay in the EMU. Additionally, some participants at the London site were also asked to wear an upper arm-worn device (IMEC armband, Figure 4.6b). Among other sensors, both the devices have an embedded three-axis accelerometer capturing XYZ raw ACC at a sam- pling frequency of 32 Hz and an electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor measuring the electrical conductance of the skin through dry electrodes.","What are the main limitations of the methodology for detecting Tonic-Clonic Seizures (TCS) described in this text, and how might these limitations be addressed in future work?",en,"Les limites principales de la méthodologie décrite pour la détection des crises tonico-cloniques (TCS) sont deux. Premièrement, le long intervalle de fenêtre utilisée pour la computation des caractéristiques EDA introduit une limitation intrinsèque en raison du retard de détection imposé par un système à temps réel. Car pour extraire les caractéristiques EDA et détecter un potentiel TCS, le système devra d'abord recueillir ces données pendant au moins 5 minutes. Deuxièmement, la méthodologie ne permet pas de détecter que des crises non-motrices, car elle repose sur les données provenant du capteur d'accélération. Pour surmonter ces défis dans le cadre de l'avenir, il est nécessaire de consacrer plus de travail pour évaluer la contribution des capteurs PPG et EDA à la détection des crises non-motrices. De plus, pour rendre le système usable en pratique clinique, de nouvelles données d'entraînement seront nécessaires, ainsi que davantage de travail pour créer un système qui peut fonctionner automatiquement comme journal des crises, sans doute en utilisant un modèle semi-personnalisé.","The main limitations are: 1) it's not suitable for real-time warning systems due to a delay in data collection, and 2) it can only detect Tonic-Clonic Seizures; non-motor seizures cannot be detected. Future work might involve using PPG and EDA sensors to detect non-motor seizures and developing a semi-personalized model for clinical practice."
"Both the devices measure the conductance between two electrodes on the skin by applying a direct current to the stratum corneum1 beneath the electrodes. The sampling frequency for the EDA measured at the ventral side of the wrist is 4 Hz (Empatica E4) and at the ventral side of the upper arm is 256 Hz (IMEC armband). The devices were worn on the nondominant hand. Video-electroencephalography (vEEG) recordings were performed using a minimum of 21 scalp electrodes. Clinical and Seizure Characteristics: For each patient, demographic and clinical data (including age at onset of epilepsy, type of epilepsy, seizure frequency, and so on) were col- lected. For each seizure recorded, data on state of wakefulness (awake/asleep), ictal focus, duration of the clonic and of the tonic phases, as well as the entire seizure duration were recorded. Convulsive seizures were classified into three categories according to Alexandre et al. [330]. Early intervention by a nurse (during the seizure or within the first 5 s after seizure termination), early administration of oxygen (with oxygen mask during the seizure or within the first 5 s after seizure termination), and prone position at seizure end were also annotated. Seizure, PGES, and PI Annotation: Two neurologists with EEG expertise reviewed the vEEG recording independently and manually labeled the start (first EEG or clinical manifes- tation) and the end of the seizures (EEG end) and the presence/absence, onset/offset, and du- ration of PI and PGES. A random sample of vEEG was reviewed by both the annotators to 1Outermost layer of the epidermis (skin) 82 CHAPTER 4.

PGES was defined as the post-ictal gener- alized absence of electroencephalographic activity <10 µV in amplitude, allowing for muscle, movement, breathing, and electrode artifacts [327]. Seizures presenting with a PGES duration ≥20 s were considered at higher SUDEP risk [327]. PI was defined as the post-ictal absence of movements (allowing for respiratory movements) on the video recording. The duration of PI was defined as the time from the onset of PI to the onset of the first post-ictal active non-respiratory movement [321]. Wearable Devices Data: Raw data from the wrist-worn wearable device (Empatica E4) were streamed via Bluetooth to an android app during the recordings and collected on a cen- tralized data server [291], as described in Section 3.2. Raw data from the upper arm device (IMEC armband) were transferred directly from the device to a laptop via cable at the end of the recording. Both devices and the vEEG were synchronized with a timeserver at the begin- ning of each recording. If there was still time drift left on the signal during a seizure, the offset was manually determined by visual comparison of the expert-labeled video and raw data. Data Analysis Automatic Detection of Post-Ictal ACC Silence: The ACC data immediately around the seizure event were plotted and visually inspected. The information obtained from the plots was used to create an algorithm for the automatic detection of the post-ictal ACC silence. Given the seizure offset marked by clinical experts, the post-ictal ACC silence detection algorithm marked the “start” of the post-ictal ACC silence if the moving standard deviation was < 0.2 for 5 s. The algorithm then marks the “end” of the post-ictal ACC silence if the moving standard deviation was ≥0.2 for at least 5 s. Thereby, the duration of the post-ictal ACC silence was calculated. The moving standard deviation was calculated over a 5 s window with maximal overlap. Electrodermal Activity: The EDA was plotted around the seizure for visual inspection. To account for the typically slow changes in tonic EDA, an additional hour of data before and after the seizure events was also included in the plots. The analysis of the EDA signal was based on Poh et al. [153]. The signal was filtered and smoothed to reduce motion artifacts and 4.2.

The start of the EDA response was defined as the point after the labeled start of the seizure where the filtered EDA signal first reached a value of baseline +2σ. The end of the response was defined as the point after the start of the response where the filtered EDA signal first dropped below 80 % of the response peak. The EDA duration was estimated as the time between start and end of the EDA response. Furthermore, the response amplitude (EDA amplitude) was defined as the difference between the response peak and the pre-ictal baseline. Statistical Analysis Linear regression was used to analyze the linear pairwise relationship between the automat- ically detected duration of post-ictal ACC silence and other variables, such as duration of PI, seizure duration, and others. The strength and direction of the linear relationship between the different pairs of variables were quantified using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Variables with P < .2 at univariate analysis were entered in a multivariate model.","What are the differences in sampling frequencies for Electrodermal Activity (EDA) measurements when using the Empatica E4 and IMEC armband devices, and how were the devices worn during the study related to seizure recordings and video-electroencephalography (vEEG)?",en,"The differences in sampling frequencies for Electrodermal Activity (EDA) measurements when using the Empatica E4 and IMEC armband devices are 4 Hz for the Empatica E4, measured at the ventral side of the wrist, and 256 Hz for the IMEC armband, measured at the ventral side of the upper arm.

"A two-sided Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to assess the relationship be- tween the duration of the post-ictal ACC silence and binary clinical variables, whereas the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for categorical variables. To account for multiple comparisons, the resulting P-values were adjusted using the Bonferroni method. Each test was performed at a significance level of .05. When seizures were captured with both the devices (Empatica E4 and IMEC armband), the signals collected from the wrist-worn device (Empatica E4) were included in the analysis. Moreover, a subgroup analysis on the EDA response captured by the wrist-worn device, producing better signals, was performed. Data were processed using 84 CHAPTER 4.

The mean age of study participants was 37.1 years (standard deviation (SD) 12.8). The mean disease duration was 19.8 years (SD 7.4) and the median number of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) taken was 2 (range 1-4). The majority of the participants (66.7 %) reported ≥3 convulsive seizures per year. All were admitted to the EMU for presurgical evaluation of their pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Eleven patients wore the wrist-worn device, four the arm band, and three both devices. Thirteen seizures were recorded with the wrist- worn device, five with the arm band and four with both. PI and ACC silence PI occurred in 20 of 22 seizures (90.9 %), whereas 2 seizures were followed by post-ictal ag- itation and confusion. PGES occurred following 15 seizures (75.0 %) and it was ≥20 s in 11 (55.0 %), which were considered at higher SUDEP risk. Early nurse intervention was performed in all the seizures recorded and consisted mainly of assisting the patient into the recovery position or repositioning the head. Oxygen was administered early in 10 seizures (45.4 %). None of the patients was observed in prone position at seizure offset due to nurse intervention. In the post-ictal period, the automated estimation of post-ictal ACC silence identified all the 20 expert-labeled PI, discarding post-ictal agitation, and performing equally in both the wrist and upper arm-worn devices. Figure 4.7 illustrates an example of the post-ictal ACC silence detected by the algorithm and its correspondence with PI labeled by experts, and an example of post-ictal agitation. Figure 4.8 illustrates the ACC signals captured during the same seizure by the two different devices and the similar performance of the algorithm on the two different body sites. Occasionally, the post-ictal ACC silence lasted beyond the PI labeled by experts, as very subtle movements of the hands 4.2.

The linear regression (Table 4.4) showed that the duration of the post-ictal ACC silence was correlated with the duration of expert-labeled PI (Pearson r = .92; P < .001; Figure 4.9), with the age of study participants (r = .78; P < .001), and with the duration of PGES (r = .4; P = .033). After inclusion of the duration of PI and age into a multivariate model, the associ- ation with the duration of PGES became non-significant. No relations were observed between the duration of post-ictal ACC silence and seizure duration, duration of the clonic phase, and duration of the tonic phase. The EDA signal was available for 16 of 20 seizures, whereas in 4 seizures the signal was either not recorded or corrupted. A post-ictal EDA response was ob- served in 13 of 16 seizures (Figure 4.8c+d). The duration and amplitude of the EDA response were not related to the duration of the post-ictal ACC silence (Table 4.4) or to the duration of the PGES (duration of EDA P = .43; amplitude of EDA P = .67). These results were also con- 86 CHAPTER 4.

The relationship between the duration of post-ictal ACC silence and categorical seizure-specific variables were also analyzed.","What is the relationship between the duration of post-ictal ACC silence and continuous clinical and seizure characteristics, as analyzed using linear regression, when considering signals collected from the Empatica E4 device?",en,"The relationship between the duration of post-ictal ACC silence and continuous clinical and seizure characteristics, as analyzed using linear regression, shows that the Pearson coefficient (r) for the duration of post-ictal ACC silence is 0.92, which indicates a strong positive correlation. However, when adjusting for multiple comparisons, only the variable PI Duration remains statistically significant at the significance level of .05 (P-Value <0.001 and P-Value = 0.000). This implies that there is a significant association between the duration of post-ictal ACC silence and PI Duration when considering signals collected from the Empatica E4 device.","The relationship shows a strong positive correlation between the duration of post-ictal ACC silence and PI Duration, Age, and EDA Duration, while weak correlations exist with Seizure Duration, Duration of Tonic Phase, Duration of Clonic Phase, PGES Duration, and EDA Amplitude.

"The post-ictal ACC silence was longer in seizures followed by PGES (adjusted P = .05), in seizures presenting a higher risk of SUDEP (PGES ≥20 s; ad- justed P = .037) and in seizures showing an EDA response (adjusted P = .038), the latter also showed longer PGES durations (adjusted P = .004). There was no association with con- vulsive seizure type and number of AEDs taken, whereas a borderline significance was found in seizures originating from the temporal lobe (adjusted P = .059) and seizures arising from sleep (adjusted P = .24). 4.2.4 Discussion ACC sensors built into consumer electronics such as smartwatches have been widely used for the identification of convulsive seizures at rest [134], additionally demonstrating good cor- relation with seizure motion duration [224]. This study demonstrated a novel application of wearable ACC. In a population at high risk of SUDEP, represented by patients with refrac- tory epilepsy, potentially candidates for epilepsy surgery, and with a large majority reporting more than three or more convulsive seizures per year, wearable ACC was an accurate digi- tal marker of PI and of its duration after convulsive seizures. Both these functions certainly 4.2. POTENTIAL USE OF TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE DETECTION 87 assume a great clinical value, providing information to identify and characterize potentially life-threatening seizures. In fact, although immobility following a convulsive seizure is a fre- quent post-ictal event, the occurrence of PI has been regarded as a precipitating factor for post-ictal cardiorespiratory dysfunction in recorded SUDEP cases [303, 323–329]. In the same context, the duration of PI has been considered as a factor contributing to the lethality of some convulsive seizures. There is an urgent need for appropriate markers to delineate individual risk of SUDEP and to track the evolution of risk factors that might predispose to SUDEP over time [331]. The possibility of automatically gathering information on the presence of dangerous post-ictal states, such as prolonged immobility, is a step forward in this direction. Alongside its role as a marker of PI, the post-ictal ACC silence was also correlated with other known SUDEP risk factors. The duration of the post-ictal ACC silence was correlated linearly with the age of study participants. This finding is of interest as age is known to affect the occurrence of seizure-related autonomic responses [332–334] and may play a role in autonomic dysregulation-supported phenomena, such as SUDEP. Notably, the average risk of SUDEP is age dependent, ranging from 0.2/1000 PY1 in children to 1.2/1000 PY in adults [19]. However, the correlation of PI with age has not been explored and additional investigations and larger samples, including children with epilepsy, are required to confirm this observation. A long post-ictal ACC silence indicated the presence of seizures followed by PGES ≥20 s (P = .037), carrying a higher risk of SUDEP [327], and a linear correlation was highlighted be- tween the duration of post-ictal ACC silence and the duration of PGES (P = .033). However, the moderate coefficient found (r = .4) suggests that a nonlinear relation may exist between these variables, and different models should be investigated in larger data sets. Moreover, the linear correlation disappeared in the multivariate model, probably due to the presence of a correlation between PGES and PI durations. These findings are consistent with, and repli- cate, previous studies analyzing the relationship between PI and PGES, where seizures asso- ciated with PGES had a longer duration of immobility as compared to those not followed by PGES [318, 319]. No association with seizure duration and duration of the clonic or tonic phase was found. The lack of association between PI and seizure duration was first reported by Gowers [335] in 1881 and confirmed in later studies [320, 321]. With some exceptions [322], additional observations demonstrated no correlation with either the duration of the convulsive phase or the tonic phase of the seizure [321]. Of interest, prolonged post-ictal ACC silence and PGES were observed in seizures showing an EDA response. However, there was no clear relation between the amplitude of the EDA and the duration of the post-ictal ACC silence or the duration of PGES, nor was higher amplitude of EDA observed in seizures associated with PGES ≥20 s, as reported elsewhere [153]. The surge of EDA in the peri-ictal period is an index of sympathetic over-activation [150] that may be relevant in the pathogenesis of SUDEP [43, 153, 336]. As hypothesized in previous literature [331], the findings presented here reinforce the idea that the combination of multiple biosignals, such as post-ictal ACC silence and EDA, could increase the possibility of identifying seizures, and likewise PWEs potentially carrying a higher likelihood of seizure-related mortality. These findings highlight the importance of an automatic assessment of PI, which may be particularly relevant for nocturnal seizures, which are often unnoticed. 1Patient-Years 88 CHAPTER 4. DETECTION OF MAJOR CONVULSIVE SEIZURES 4.2.5 Limitations This study is limited in several aspects, which are highlighted in the following. The small sample of patients and seizures may limit the generalizability of findings, which need to be interpreted with caution and replicated in larger cohorts and in real-life settings. Nevertheless, the small cohort included here is certainly of interest given that it is potentially at higher risk for SUDEP due to its characteristics. Moreover, the automatic detection of PI presented here depends on the prior marking of the preceding convulsive seizure. Thus, in a real-world system, this methodology would need to be preceded by an independent automatic seizure detection. This limitation is further explored in Section 4.3. PI was defined as the post-ictal absence of movements, allowing for respiratory move- ments that are not detectable with wearable ACC and cessation of which is relevant for pos- sible SUDEP events. However, the evidence on how PI contributes to SUDEP is uncertain and not exhaustive. It is likely that the absence of body movements represents an “early stage” of total cessation of movements (including respiratory movements), and that the automatic identification of such an “early sign” (alone or, preferably, in association with tools to detect hypoxemia) may be clinically significant. Seizures were recorded with two different devices.","What is the significance of using accelerometer sensors built into consumer electronics like smartwatches in identifying seizures, particularly in a high-risk population for Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP), and how does this study demonstrate a novel application of wearable accelerometry?",en,"The use of accelerometer sensors built into consumer electronics like smartwatches is significant for identifying seizures, particularly in high-risk populations for Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). This is because these devices can accurately detect post-ictal immobility (PI) and its duration after convulsive seizures. The study demonstrates a novel application of wearable accelerometry by showing that it can be effectively used as a digital marker for PI and its duration in a population at high risk of SUDEP, which includes patients with refractory epilepsy, potential candidates for epilepsy surgery, and individuals who experience more than three or more convulsive seizures per year. This information can help identify and characterize potentially life-threatening seizures, providing clinical value in managing these conditions.","The significance lies in the identification of convulsive seizures, particularly in high-risk SUDEP populations. This study demonstrates a novel use of wearable accelerometry by accurately marking post-seizure immobility and its duration, providing crucial information to identify life-threatening seizures."
"Although this may have influenced the data recorded and in particular the EDA response, which is more easily detected at the wrist as compared to the arm, the ACC biosensors had similar characteristics and the signals obtained during periods of movement and immobility were comparable despite the different position of the device on the upper limb. False detection is a potential major weakness of wearable technology applied to both seizure and seizure-related phenomena detection. The trade-off between detection benefits and potential false detection should always be accounted for when dealing with digital technologies. Scenarios where a device has fallen from the patient during a seizure due to an incorrectly fastened wristband, or where at the end of the seizure the patient is lying on the limb to which the device is attached causing abnormal measurement noise, may occur, although they were not specifically observed in this cohort. Despite being possible, these events are probably infrequent, making the beneficial effects of PI detection greater than the nuisance of potential but rare false detections. ACC false detections may be mitigated by the simultaneous use of video and automated analysis. Video has been used as a sensitive way to quantify movement [269] and could enable remote detection of PI. However, although feasible especially in seizures happening from sleep (which are considered at higher risk of SUDEP), automated video detection may present disadvantages. In a mobile patient, video can be as uninformative as wearable ACC if the patient leaves the predefined space where the camera is placed and, at night and during sleep, when patients are covered by blankets. The duration of post-ictal ACC silence sometimes lasts beyond the PI labeled by experts. According to the definition of PI used here, experts considered subtle movements as “PI end”. However, these movements were mainly hand, finger, or neck movements, which are certainly insufficient for an adequate body repositioning after a seizure. It is then likely that the dura- tion of post-ictal ACC silence is a better indicator of the duration of dangerous post-ictal states during which the patient is still unable to move. Nurse intervention was prompt in many of the events recorded and has likely interfered with the cascade of post-ictal events observed. PI in SUDEP cases has often been observed in combination with a prone position in the bed [303, 323–329], a variable that could add a layer in the assessment of SUDEP risk. However, none of the patients included in this study were prone due to nurse intervention, preventing the assessment of usefulness of the gyroscope in combination with ACC to identify the body po- 4.2. POTENTIAL USE OF TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE DETECTION 89 sition post-ictally. Conversely, the passive movements produced during nurse intervention had no impact on the detection of PI via ACC, as they consisted mainly of assisting the pa- tient into the recovery position (body rotation) or in repositioning the head, resulting in either non-detectable movements or short, rapid accelerations (<5 s). In conclusion, PI is one of the most common seizure-activated phenomena, often associated with negative outcomes, which this study shows to be easily monitored via new technologies at different body sites. In combination with other remote measures and paired with an auto- mated identification of convulsive seizures, the detection of the post-ictal ACC silence could be regarded as a risk assessment tool in individual seizures, as a way to monitor disease pro- gression and evolution and, possibly, as a potentially modifiable outcome when assessing the impact of preventive measures, interventions, and surveillance systems. 90 CHAPTER 4. DETECTION OF MAJOR CONVULSIVE SEIZURES 4.3 Summary This chapter investigated the detection of convulsive tonic-clonic seizures and related clin- ical manifestations. Convulsive seizures such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures are what popular culture typically refers to when portray- ing an epileptic seizure, and they are among the most high-profile and dangerous seizure types in terms of their semiology. This, on the other hand, also potentially makes them the most straightforward to detect using biosignals captured by typical wearable sensors. High- amplitude and high-frequency movements are represented in accelerometry (ACC) signals as oscillations in all three axes with the selfsame characteristics. Changes of the autonomous ner- vous system that frequently occur peri-ictally in these seizures are reproduced in the traces of electrodermal activity (EDA) and blood volume pulse signals, although the latter are rarely usable as the strong motion of the body during tonic-clonic seizures (TCSs) also induces heavy artifacting in the raw photoplethysmography sensor signal. The first part of the chapter presents a convulsive seizure detection pipeline, employing an ensemble machine learning model (gradient boosted decision trees) trained with features from ACC and EDA biosignal data. From a data set of 10 participants from two clinical cohorts with a total of 21 recorded TCSs, the methodology could detect 91 % of the seizures in an out- of-sample test set. Adding additional data from participants without recorded seizures to the test set, thus amounting to 78 days of wearable data, the model produced a false alarm rate of 0.19/24 h. The study accordingly shows that supervised machine learning can achieve a high sensitivity and low false positive rate in detecting convulsive TCSs. The second part of the chapter highlights a specific clinical manifestation of convulsive TCSs, post-ictal immobility (PI), a period of unconsciousness occurring after such a seizure that can be a major risk factor regarding sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). An automatic detection of this period could facilitate an alarm system, potentially alerting care- takers that the patient is unconscious after a seizure and needs immediate care. In 20 cases of PI from 18 study participants the heuristic algorithm based on ACC signals was able to identify all events, showing significant correlation between the detected and the true length of the PI period. The continuous detection of risk factors associated with seizures is of great clinical importance, and the study shows that wearables may be a useful tool for this task. The two studies, while at first glance are both focused specifically on convulsive TCSs, are not immediately compatible.","What potential issues related to false detection could arise when using wearable technology for seizure and seizure-related phenomena detection, and how might these scenarios be mitigated or accounted for?",en,"Potential issues related to false detection when using wearable technology for seizure and seizure-related phenomena detection include false alarms due to regular body movements or non-seizure activities, and scenarios where the device may be dislodged during a seizure or the patient lies on the limb attached to the device after a seizure, causing abnormal measurement noise. These issues can be mitigated by accounting for the trade-off between detection benefits and potential false detections, ensuring proper fastening of the wristband, and using simultaneous video and automated analysis. Video has been used as a sensitive way to quantify movement and could enable remote detection of PI, but it may present disadvantages, especially in cases where automatic video detection is used.","Potential issues in false detection include device dislodgement during a seizure and abnormal measurement noise. These can be mitigated by ensuring proper fastening, using simultaneous video analysis, and accounting for the trade-off between benefits and potential false detections."
"The identification of PI is based on prior knowledge of the occurrence of a convulsive seizure, and so a potential SUDEP warning system would need to be extended by an automatic seizure detection. The detection methodology presented in the first part is however not entirely applicable as the detection delay caused by the choice of features from the multimodal biosignal data makes it impracticable for this purpose. Most essentially, the long-term feature calculation window of 5 min into the future for the EDA features introduces a delay that is likely to be longer than the seizure itself. The long EDA feature window duration was chosen to meaningfully represent the long-term response of the signal after a seizure, with a drop of the signal down to a baseline typically occurring over the span of multiple minutes. As such, the detector would only recognize the seizure when the PI phase has already begun, or possibly even after it. A convulsive seizure detector as a pre-stage for a PI warning system would need to feature a detection delay of at most a few seconds to be useful. While not universally reported, some related studies also include detection latencies for their methodologies. Onorati et al. [224], for example, report latencies of ≈30 s for their 4.3. SUMMARY 91 TCS classifiers based on ACC and EDA data, and Milosevic et al. [337] cite a median latency of 10.5 s over 22 nocturnal TCSs from 7 patients, based on ACC and electromyography data. For the detection methodology presented here in Section 4.1, some further feature engineering work and subsequent model optimization would be necessary to transform it into a system suited for a SUDEP warning system. In particular, the EDA features would need to be changed, specifically the long window duration as mentioned above. This would likely involve taking into account only the quick response to a peak value and not the slow minute-long decline back to a baseline. That is to say, such a lower-latency detection system seems to be within the realm of possibilities, but ultimately was not part of the research included in this thesis. Overall, the research presented here shows that multimodal detection of convulsive TCSs is not only possible, but useful and necessary to tackle ultra-long-term monitoring of patients with epilepsy. The studies furthermore demonstrate that even very limited data sets can enable simple classical supervised machine learning algorithms to robustly detect convulsive seizures with high sensitivities and low false alarm rates. Yet, the automatic detection of focal onset seizures is another matter and requires separate analysis, introduced in the next chapter.

DETECTION OF FOCAL ONSET SEIZURES F ocal seizures, meaning those seizures with a localized onset in only one hemisphere of the brain, are the most prevalent type of seizure, and at the same time the most heterogeneous in terms of seizure semiology. Thereby, they are typically also less convulsive or do not exhibit movement symptoms at all, and are thus considered harder to detect automatically by the kind of wearable biosignal data used here. In this thesis, and the studies included in this chapter, only those focal seizures are involved that encompass motor symptoms, specifically tonic or clonic movements of the limbs. Other focal seizure types, particularly those without any movements, require separate analysis and potentially the use of other combinations of biosignals. This heterogeneity of focal seizures is highlighted in the first part of this chapter, which comprises an explorative investigation of different types of focal motor seizures recorded from three distinct patients with epilepsy.","What modifications would be necessary to make an automatic seizure detection system effective as a precursor for a Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) warning system, given that the current detection methodology has a significant delay due to its choice of features from multimodal biosignal data and a long-term feature calculation window?",en,"To make an automatic seizure detection system effective as a precursor for a Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) warning system, the following modifications would be necessary:

1. Reducing the detection delay: Since the current methodology has a significant delay due to its choice of features from multimodal biosignal data, it is essential to reduce this delay to make the system useful for a SUDEP warning system. The ideal detection delay should be a few seconds at most.

2. Revising the feature calculation window: The long-term feature calculation window (e.g., 5 minutes into the future) should be revised to minimize the delay in seizure detection. This might require finding features that provide meaningful representations of the seizure without requiring such a long duration for accurate detection.

3. Investigating alternative or complementary detection methods: Some related studies have reported detection latencies, suggesting that alternative or complementary methodologies with shorter latencies could be explored to improve the accuracy and timeliness of seizure detection. For instance, studies based on electrocardiography (ECG) data or other modalities might offer reduced latency without compromising accuracy.

4. Validating the new methodology: Once modifications have been made, it is crucial to validate the new seizure detection methodology in terms of its accuracy, delay, and effectiveness as a precursor for a SUDEP warning system. This validation should ideally be done through experiments or simulations using real-world data from epilepsy patients.","A shorter detection delay is needed for the seizure detector, ideally a few seconds. This could be achieved by using features with less computation time and reducing the long-term feature calculation window."
"While this study has limited significance in terms of eval- uating new focal seizure detection methodology, it gives a meaningful and deliberate insight into potential uncertainties these seizures hold regarding biosignal data. Chronologically it was the first major analysis work in the context of this thesis, and the data collection studies were still ongoing at that time. The second part of the chapter, in turn, features the chronologically last major analysis work for this thesis, building upon the experiences of the other research conducted in the meantime. It investigates the feasibility of a detector for focal motor seizures both in an in- dividualized context and across patients. To that end, the presented methodology modifies the existing detection pipeline from Section 4.1, adding blood volume pulse as a modality and selecting features specifically suitable for focal motor seizure detection. 5.1.

No substantial changes altering the results were made. Own Contributions: • All 5.1.1 Introduction The few wearable devices that thus far have been used in epilepsy research are most com- monly smartwatch-like devices or fitness trackers that record biosignals such as accelerom- etry (ACC), electrodermal activity (EDA), blood pulse via photoplethysmography (PPG), and electromyography (EMG). These biosignals have been shown to give sufficient indication to- wards epileptic seizures, with research focusing on monomodal and multimodal detection of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs). GTCSs are one type of seizure that involves both hemispheres of the brain and present themselves in violent bilateral muscle contractions of the whole body. These are very different from focal seizures (FSs), which start in only one brain hemisphere and can present themselves in a number of different symptoms that are far harder to characterize. Other research has explored the detection of FSs with wearable data, however a majority of these efforts have focused on detecting a specific type of FS only, often by using a single modality. This work proposes a multimodal approach to detect FSs, which has thus far been a new and underexplored avenue in epileptic seizure detection. It offers a first analysis into the chal- lenges that lie ahead, especially in the analysis of the various subtypes of FSs and the impli- cations this holds for classification tasks in particular. In the following, the current state of the art in epileptic seizure detection with wearables is explored, followed by the introduction of a new data set of biosignal data from wearables worn by three in-hospital patients that were monitored with video-electroencephalography (vEEG) in a medical epilepsy monitoring unit, along with wearable sensors (Figure 5.1). This study focuses specifically on showing the difficulties that may arise when implementing a multimodal seizure detection pipeline for variable types of seizures, using common biosignals such as ACC, EDA and PPG. The detection of seizures from three selected patients is evaluated, and the results are analyzed. Concluding, an outlook on the development of the detection pipeline is given. 96 CHAPTER 5.

The time series shows from top to bottom: 3-axis accelerometry in x/y/z, blood volume pulse, and electrodermal activity, with the video frame’s timestamp marked by the black line. 5.1.2 Related Work This section on research work in the detection of epileptic seizures is structured along the two main types of seizures, GTCSs and FSs, as most research to date has explicitly focused on one or the other. Monitoring these two types of seizures has also shown to require very different modalities. Refer to Chapter 2 for a more extensive look at related work in the field of wearable biosignal monitoring and epilepsy. Due to the severe manifestation in body and especially limb movements, GTCSs are rela- tively straightforward to detect using standard wearable biosignals like ACC or EMG. More- over, GTCSs are a significant risk factor in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, raising inter- est in the automatic detection of this type of seizures, especially in an ambulatory setting [338]. There are various examples of GTCS detection in literature, both with monomodal and multi- modal data (see also Chapter 4). One basic approach is evaluated by Kusmakar et al. [215] who use accelerometry data from a wrist-worn wearable to detect short-length GTCSs in 12 patients. Their approach with a sup- port vector method and standard time domain features achieves a sensitivity of 95 % and false alarm rate (FAR) of 0.7/24 h. Halford et al. [339] on the other hand use an upper arm wearable that records surface EMG signals on 199 patients with epilepsy. Their thresholding method detects 76 % of overall GTCSs, with a FAR of 2.5/24 h. However, they also distinguished be- tween properly and improperly placed devices, reporting that among properly placed devices 100 % of GTCSs were detected with a FAR of 1.4/24 h. They conclude that proper placement of the device is important. EDA and ACC signals are used by Poh et al. [153] to detect 94 % of GTCSs in a data set from 80 patients, with a FAR of 0.7/24 h. More recently, Regalia et al. [293] also used EDA and ACC signals to detect GTCSs, attaining a sensitivity of greater than 92 % with a FAR between 0.2 and 1 per day on varying data sets of inpatient and outpatient studies. Also known as partial seizures, FSs are seizures that have their source in one of the brain’s hemispheres, as opposed to GTCSs which spread over both. FSs are therefore usually not accompanied by severe motor reactions of the body like in GTCSs, but rather manifest in 5.1.",What is the focus and purpose of the exploratory analysis of focal motor seizures as presented in Section 5.1 of this study?,en,"The focus and purpose of the exploratory analysis of focal motor seizures, as presented in Section 5.1 of this study, is to investigate the feasibility of a detector for focal motor seizures, both in an individualized context and across patients. This is achieved by modifying the existing detection pipeline from Section 4.1, adding blood volume pulse as a modality, and selecting features specifically suitable for focal motor seizure detection.","The focus of the exploratory analysis in Section 5.1 is to investigate the feasibility of a detector for focal motor seizures, using multimodal biosignal data from wearables, across individual epilepsy patients."
"EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF FOCAL MOTOR SEIZURES 97 a multitude of different symptoms: These can include autonomous reactions like heart rate increase (tachycardia), dyscognitive features like impaired awareness or unconsciousness, less severe motor components, or so-called auras, which are sensory phenomenons such as déjà vu sensations or dizziness. During the course of one FS, multiple of these symptoms may occur consecutively or simultaneously. In literature, the detection of FSs with wearables has been attracting more attention in the recent past. Some research studies have considered single modalities to detect FSs of specific types. Jeppesen et al. [237] look at heart rate variability from electrocardiography (ECG) for 17 patients, detecting 74 % of seizures with their method. Poh et al. [153] on the other hand use an EDA sensor to analyze autonomic changes during and especially after FSs and GTCSs, concluding that the EDA response after GTCSs is much more severe and prolonged than in FSs. A different approach is taken by Vandecasteele et al. [74], who compare wearable ECG and PPG devices in the detection performance of temporal lobe epileptic seizures, which are a type of FS. They report sensitivities of 70 % for ECG and 32 % for PPG detection, with FARs of 2.1/24 h and 1.8/24 h, respectively. Recently, some studies have also expanded to multimodal detection of FSs. Cogan et al. [227] propose a multistaged detection system that uses heart rate, arterial oxygenation, ACC, EDA and temperature data, detecting 100 % of FSs in the sensor readings from nearly all 10 patients their data set consists of. However, they do not specify further what type of FS they worked with, only referring to the detected seizures as complex partial, an older term for focal seizures. The work presented here is most comparable with that of Onorati et al. [224], who use EDA and ACC data from 69 patients to detect GTCSs as well as FSs, comparing three different classification methods. Their best performing method reaches a sensitivity of 95 %, with a FAR of 0.2/24 h and an F-score of 0.67 in cross-validation. However, their data set of 55 convulsive seizures only includes six focal seizures. Among the above research works, there are several studies in literature that present mon- omodal and multimodal seizure detection on large data sets, however, these are often very generalized in what seizure types are included. The distinction between GTCSs and FSs is often made, but subtypes within FSs are rarely investigated or separated in the annotation. The work presented here illustrates the breadth of FSs by focusing specifically on the multi- modal detection of three distinct types of focal motor seizures in three individual patients and therein identifies difficulties that may arise when analyzing a larger data set of focal seizures. Furthermore, this work explores a way of feature extraction that enables using multimodal data with multiple different window sizes per modality. In other studies only a single window size with a fixed overlap per modality is commonly used. 5.1.3 Data Set The evaluation presented here uses selected data that are taken from a data collection clinical study. In this study, epilepsy patients that were continuously monitored in epilepsy monitor- ing units at two study sites were recruited and asked to wear a wearable wristband device, the Empatica E4 (Section 3.2.1; Empatica Inc., Boston, MA, USA), and a wearable upper-arm device, the Biovotion Everion. Both sensor units record ACC (32 Hz/50 Hz), EDA (4 Hz/1 Hz), and PPG (64 Hz/50 Hz) data continuously. The goal of the study was to capture a variable set of seizures for a population of at least N = 200 patients, while recording at least one seizure 98 CHAPTER 5.

The study is divided across two clinical sites, the King’s College Hospital London and the UKF. Chapter 3 further details the study procedures. The ground truth for seizure labeling is provided by a clinically trained expert, who scans through the vEEG recordings from the epilepsy monitoring unit and manually marks seizure onset and offset, as well as timings of various seizure phases, such as tonic movement, clonic movement, tachycardia, or unconsciousness. Patients are typically recorded for stretches of 5 to 7 days, and tend to suffer from any type of epilepsy. At the time of the writing of this part of the thesis, the data set included data from 174 patients from both sites, with 276 complete seizures recorded from 70 patients, respectively. Selection of three cases For the preliminary evaluation presented here, only a select set of participants in the study is considered from a single site, that is, three representative cases that are to be investigated. For each of the three patients in question, more than five FSs with varying types of motor components were recorded, and these patients were selected for their different seizure man- ifestations: One patient exhibited highly characteristic tonic arm movements that are clearly distinguishable on the raw ACC signal. The second patient had predominantly automatisms in their arms, which are often random movements of the limb that can be classified as neither tonic nor clonic. The third patient also had automatisms, however these were not located in the arms, but rather – more challenging for seizure detection – in the legs and also mouth region (oroalimentary).","What methods and technologies have been explored in recent literature to detect Focal Seizures using wearable devices, and what are some of the key findings regarding their effectiveness?",en,"In recent literature, several methods and technologies have been explored for the detection of Focal Seizures (FS) using wearable devices. Some research studies have focused on single modalities such as electrocardiography (ECG) for detecting specific types of seizures. For instance, Jeppesen et al. found that they could detect 74% of seizures by examining heart rate variability from ECG in 17 patients.

Another example using a single modality is the study by Poh et al., who analyzed autonomic changes during and especially after FSs and Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures (GTCS) with an Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensor, concluding that the EDA response after GTCSs was more severe and prolonged than in FSs.

Vandecasteele et al., in their study, compared wearable ECG and PPG devices in the detection performance of temporal lobe epileptic seizures, a type of FS. They reported sensitivities of 70% for ECG and 32% for PPG detection, with False Alarm Rates (FARs) of 2.1/24 h and 1.8/24 h, respectively.

Recently, there has been an expansion towards multimodal detection of FSs. Cogan et al. proposed a multistaged detection system that uses heart rate, arterial oxygenation (ACC), electroencephalography (EEG), and other sensors to improve the accuracy of seizure detection.

The key findings regarding their effectiveness suggest that while single-modality approaches can provide some level of accuracy, multimodal methods may offer better performance in detecting FSs using wearable devices. However, more research is needed to confirm these trends and further optimize these technologies for practical use.","Methods include ECG for heart rate variability analysis, EDA sensors for autonomic changes, and multimodal detection systems like the one proposed by Cogan et al., which use heart rate, arterial oxygenation, ACC, etc. Effectiveness varies: Jeppesen detects 74% of seizures, Poh finds more severe and prolonged EDA response after GTCSs than FSs, Vandecasteele reports sensitivities of 70% for ECG and 32% for PPG with relatively low false alarm rates."
"Among the three selected patients, a total of 22 seizures had motor features, and most of them also had autonomic or dyscognitive features, or auras associated with them. Table 5.1 gives a brief overview of the main characteristics for the three selected patients. The following evaluation highlights the ACC and EDA data from the Empatica E4 device. Feature Set In order to be able to train a supervised model with multimodal data with differing sample rates, the mixed modality feature set used here has variable window lengths per feature, but at 5.1. EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF FOCAL MOTOR SEIZURES 99 ACC features EDA features EDA baseline tn tn+1 tn-1 T time tn-2 tn-3 Figure 5.2: Graphical representation of the mixed EDA and ACC feature set used in the eval- uation, with fixed feature points tn and T = 1 s. fixed time intervals T = tn+1−tn. Thus, in this approach the window lengths and interval size are the determining factors of the feature set, contrary to the usual method of defining window lengths and overlap. Since it is unclear from existing literature what window lengths are best for specific modalities for epileptic FS detection, this approach facilitates testing several window lengths at the same time for later analysis of the best combination of features and window lengths. More specifically, the resulting tables of features will have values at the same time points for all modalities and all window sizes, allowing the feature data to be concatenated into one table for model training. Figure 5.2 shows a graphical representation of this mixed feature set. The feature set for this evaluation consists of 141 ACC features from the time and frequency domains (divided into 40 subgroups when grouping together x, y, z, and total features), and an additional 10 EDA features, some of which are also corrected for a baseline. With window lengths of 2 s, 10 s and 20 s for the ACC features and 5 min, 10 min and 20 min for the EDA features, a total of 453 features were calculated for each fixed time point. Note the large dif- ference in window lengths for EDA vs. ACC; Since the EDA signal is primarily analyzed for tonic activity features, and the time frame of change in EDA signals is in the order of minutes, the window lengths for EDA were chosen like this. Furthermore, for this evaluation the time interval between feature points is fixed at T = 1 s. To avoid feature intervals with undefined values, feature extraction is only done on sections of the data where all modalities are present, that is, where there is a data point in all modalities for a given timestamp. 5.1.4 Evaluation For evaluation, the described feature set was divided into sets per seizure per participant, each containing the feature data from the time interval [sstart −55 min; send + 55 min], where sstart and send refer to the seizure start and end, respectively, as labeled by a clinically trained expert via the vEEG recordings. One seizure data set thus consists of 55 min before the seizure start and after the seizure end, as well as the duration of the seizure itself, which for the 22 seizures of the three selected patients had a mean of 1 min 55 s. Thus, one seizure accounts for approximately 112 min of data, amounting to approximately 41 h of data for all seizures of the three selected patients. The 55 min margin was chosen due to the large EDA window sizes and characteristically long EDA response time. Typical EDA response times can last up to an hour after the actual seizure has ended [153]. 100 CHAPTER 5.

The evaluation was done sample-wise, that is, each time point is classified as either belonging to a seizure or not. The cross-validation for each patient was repeated 20 times to give a confident idea of the RF model performance. Additionally, a second round of tests was done, where the interval for the feature data now is [sstart −55 min; send] + [send + 5 min; send + 55 min], thus excluding data from detection for 5 min after a seizure was already recognized. This can be seen as the simulation of a post-detection pause of data analysis, which prevents false positive detections resulting from large uncertainty in data following immediately after a seizure. Before the scoring of the tests, the predicted labels are smoothed by a hysteresis function with a threshold of 10 s. Effectively, this means all consecutive positive predictions of less than 10 s are disregarded, and all consecutive negative predictions of less than 10 s within a larger positive block are still regarded as positive. The results for all tests can be found in Table 5.2 and will be discussed in the following. 5.1.5 Discussion Since this is a sample-wise cross-validation, the scores from this evaluation give an overview of the performance of the RF model with respect to the classification of seizure status for each second in the test data sets; As opposed to event-based classification which would give an overview of the performance with respect to the classification of overall seizure events. Fur- thermore, since for this sample-based evaluation the train and test sets are highly unbalanced, only precision, recall and F1-score are regarded as measures.","What is the significance of the variable window lengths per feature in the mixed modality feature set used for evaluating focal motor seizures, and how does it differ from the traditional method of defining windows in such evaluations?",en,"The variable window lengths per feature in the mixed modality feature set for evaluating focal motor seizures have significance as they enable testing several window lengths at once for later analysis, rather than fixing a specific window length. This approach differs from the traditional method of defining windows in such evaluations, where a fixed window length and overlap are usually predefined, and the window size is a determining factor of the feature set. By using this method, the researcher can explore the best combination of features and window lengths for epileptic focal seizure detection more effectively.",The variable window lengths per feature in this mixed modality feature set enables testing multiple window lengths simultaneously for epileptic FS detection. This differs from traditional methods where specific window lengths are defined beforehand.
"The imbalance derives from the choice of seizure data set, that is, data for one seizure includes 55 min of negative data before and after the seizure that typically has a length of <5 min, with a mean of 1 min 55 s for the selected seizures, or 1.7 % compared to negative data. The performance for P1 is acceptable in data set 1, without the simulation of a post- detection pause, and increases considerably in data set 2, where 5 min of data are cut off after a seizure. This behavior is expected, as there often are detections right after the seizure in data set 1, as can be seen in Figure 5.3. Especially the precision score is affected by this, as primarily false positive classifications after a seizure are avoided. For P1 the recall score also improves substantially with data set 2, showing that the detection of clear and characteristic motor FSs may benefit the most from this method. Contrarily, for P3 recall scores improve less than precision. Overall however, the seizures of P3 are not detected as reliable as those of P1. This is expected considering that those seizures are not extensively represented in the motion data, due to the seizure manifestation in automa- 5.1.

[106]. tisms occurring in the opposite arm that the device was attached to. There is no substantial change in scores for P2 after post-seizure classification pause, while the overall scores of that patient are comparable to those of P1. This may indicate that for the type of automatisms this patient was exhibiting, classification is invariant to post-seizure uncertainty, or – alternatively – that there is none. Looking at the predictions from the point of view of time series event recognition, most predictions are in immediate time proximity to the seizure ground truth, with only few false positives. Figure 5.3 for instance shows that while there are some false predictions immediately after a seizure, the rest of the 55 min before and after the seizure is, correctly, free from seizure predictions. The results in Table 5.3 were attained from examining a single run of the cross- validation for all patients and counting the event-wise true and false positives. In these results, a true positive is any ground truth event that overlaps with a predicted event, and a false positive is any predicted event that does not overlap with a ground truth event. The FARs for each patient are rough estimates that were obtained by counting the false positives over the whole seizure data set: FARest = nfp/(112 min·nsz). These results show that even this basic RF approach can already reach a performance comparable to that of related literature when regarding only sensitivity, while estimated FARs are still high, but may in reality be lower when testing on a whole patient recording. However, the purpose of this study is not to compare performance to the current state of the art, but to analyze the challenges in the multimodal classification of epileptic focal seizures, 102 CHAPTER 5. DETECTION OF FOCAL ONSET SEIZURES Table 5.3: Event-based results for a single run of the cross-validation. FARs are rough esti- mates, calculated from the number of false positive (FP) over the whole duration of the seizure data sets combined, for each patient. ID TP (%) FP estimated FAR P1 6/6 (100) 2 4.3/24 h P2 7/9 (78) 2 2.9/24 h P3 3/7 (43) 11 20.2/24 h and specifically those with motor features. These motor features can manifest themselves in many different ways. As the selection of patients in this study shows, there are motor features that are not captured by data from a single wearable. Even with multimodal ACC and EDA data, seizures that manifest themselves, for example, in a limb that the wearable is not directly attached to may be missed. While an additional modality like features from PPG may help with this, it is essential that the wearable collecting data is attached to the body part that the seizures are most predominantly located in, with respect to individual patients. Post-seizure movement is another factor that makes some FSs difficult to detect accurately. Especially in a hospital environment patients may move in a way that makes accelerometry models less accurate, for example, due to nurse intervention. A further modality next to ACC may help with this, but the large timeframe in which EDA changes happen make it less ideal for that specific purpose. One way to counteract this is also to stop looking for seizures for some time after one was already detected, which is shown here to help with detection accu- racy. Furthermore, multiple detections that are located within a certain time frame should be counted as one event, to reduce false alarm rates. Lastly, due to the nature of epileptic seizures and their infrequent occurrence, the available data are highly imbalanced towards the negative class. The evaluation shown here tries to alleviate this problem somewhat, by segmenting out the seizures within a certain time interval. Yet, other measures could be taken to counteract the imbalance. For example, data during sleep may be cut out by looking for periods of very little activity in accelerometry data. In the end however, this problem remains somewhat unsolved in seizure detection with wearable data. 5.1.6 Conclusions This study presents findings that focus on the multimodal detection of FSs from wearable sensor data.","What is the impact on the performance of P1 and P3 when using data sets 1 and 2, particularly on their precision and recall scores, and why does this variation occur?",en,"The use of data set 1 for P1's performance shows acceptable results without a significant post-detection pause simulation. However, the performance for P1 improves significantly in data set 2, where 5 minutes of data are cut off after a seizure. This improvement is more evident on precision and recall scores. For P1, the recall score substantially improves with data set 2, indicating that the detection of clear and characteristic motor FSs benefits from this method. Contrarily, for P3, recall scores improve less than precision, and overall, seizures of P3 are not detected as reliably as those of P1. This variation occurs because data set 1 includes more negative data (55 minutes) before and after the seizure (typically under 5 minutes), which can result in false positive classifications right after a seizure. Removing this extra negative data in data set 2 avoids these false positives, thereby improving precision and recall scores for P1 but less so for P3.","Using data set 1, P1's precision is acceptable but not as good in data set 2 due to fewer false positives after a seizure. Recall for both improves significantly in data set 2, especially for P1, suggesting clear motor FS detection benefits from this method. P3 recall improves less than precision, and its seizures are less reliably detected compared to P1. This variation occurs because data set 2 cuts off 5 minutes of data after a seizure, which reduces false positives (precision) but potentially misses seizures (recall)."
"Data from three patients with epilepsy exhibiting different types of FSs were examined, showing that they manifest very differently in both the sensor signals and classifi- cation performance measures. This heterogeneity will inherently hinder accurate recognition of any FS from wearable assessment data, and needs to be taken into account when designing a learning model for seizure detection. While the experiments shown here are promising for further work, it is clear that this is only a first step in building a system for multimodal detection of FSs using biosignal data from wearables. The results in Table 5.2 show that while this approach may work for individual pa- tients with characteristic motor seizure manifestation, it may not work for patients exhibiting other seizure types. Furthermore, comparing the results of the first and second experiments shows that ignoring a certain amount of time after a seizure detection can substantially im- prove the detection performance. While the evaluation shown here is based on sample-wise 5.1. EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF FOCAL MOTOR SEIZURES 103 scoring, a fully implemented system has to be based on events, that is, consecutive positive predictions must be consolidated into one seizure event, which would be scored as a hit if it has some overlap with a ground truth event. An outlook on such a system is given by the re- sults in Table 5.3, showing the performance of the presented system when scored on an event basis. The selection of three specific patients with focal motor seizures illustrates some core prob- lems that a more advanced detection system needs to deal with. In the future, the cross-patient seizure detection of such a system needs to be evaluated as well. While individual-based de- tection is one possible approach, the need for generalized models is apparent, and current state-of-the-art moves in the direction of individual-invariant models. Furthermore, a sys- tem’s performance on different types of seizures like autonomic or dyscognitive FSs needs to be evaluated. Therefore, PPG features need to be considered in addition to the ACC and EDA features already implemented. Multi-class classification of seizure types and specifically recognition of phases within focal seizures are reasonable goals that may be achieved by a detection system that takes into account the high variance in focal seizure manifestations. 104 CHAPTER 5.

Own Contributions: • All, except clinical expertise and the data collection at the KCL site 5.2.1 Introduction Epileptic seizures are defined by a period of abnormal neuronal activity in the brain, and are generally divided into two main groups by their neurological onset [27]. Seizures with an early bilateral involvement are called generalized seizures, while seizures with just a single point of onset are denoted as focal onset seizures, but epileptic activity can propagate across the brain resulting in “focal to bilateral” seizures with characteristic motor manifestations. Bilateral tonic-clonic seizures have been assessed in numerous studies as to the viability of wearables for the detection during recent years, and detection has been demonstrated to be feasible in multiple retrospective studies [104, 226, 227, 280, 315, 340–343]. Conversely, focal seizures in general are still a relatively unexplored field with respect to wearable non-electro- encephalography (EEG) detection [74, 106, 110, 219, 235, 344]. Symptoms and manifestations of these seizures are much more heterogeneous as compared to those of bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, with some barely or not at all captured by typical wearable biosignal modalities, such as accelerometry (ACC), electrodermal activity (EDA), or photoplethysmography (PPG). Focal seizures can be roughly divided into two categories: those with motor and those with- out motor manifestations. Non-motor symptoms, that is, those without involuntary movement of the body, may include partial loss of awareness or consciousness, cognitive impairment, or emotional or sensory symptoms. Motor symptoms, on the other hand, can include tonic or clonic movements of the limbs or body in general, hyperkinetic movements, or automatisms. A single epileptic seizure can thereby be composed of multiple types of manifestations, in parallel or sequentially. This work highlights difficulties in the detection of focal onset epileptic seizures, specifi- cally those with focal tonic or clonic motor symptoms but without bilateral propagation, from biosignal data captured by wearable devices. A data set consisting of multimodal data from a wrist-worn wearable was recorded from patients with epilepsy during their in-hospital stay at an epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU). Classical supervised machine learning is applied in or- der to assess the utility of this kind of data for the detection of seizures, in the context of an automated seizure diary. As written diaries created by the patients themselves have been demonstrated to be very inaccurate and often severely undercount seizures even for convul- sive seizures [54, 102, 304], an automated diary tool implementing an objective seizure identi- 5.2. DETECTION OF FOCAL MOTOR SEIZURES 105 fication and quantification is needed, for example, as a basis for treatment decisions made by epileptologists. In the supervised methodology employed here data are first labeled, based on parallel video-electroencephalography (vEEG) monitoring, as “seizure” or not “seizure”, and then processed into meaningful features and given to the machine learning model for training. Thus, the trained model can then be used to automatically classify new data. Specifically, this study uses gradient boosted decision trees (GBT) as the seizure detection model. To evaluate such an approach, and subsequently also determine the application in a real-world system, two procedures can be applied: intra-subject or inter-subject evaluation. The intra-subject evaluation focuses on the performance of the methodology when applied to data from a sin- gle patient, while the inter-subject evaluation assesses the performance over multiple patients with potentially different types of epilepsy and seizure manifestations.","What factors should be considered when designing a learning model for seizure detection using biosignal data from wearables, given the heterogeneity of seizures among patients and the potential impact of ignoring certain time intervals after a seizure detection on detection performance?",en,"To design an effective learning model for seizure detection using biosignal data from wearables, considerations should include:

1. The heterogeneity of seizures among patients: Since different types of seizures manifest differently in both sensor signals and classification performance measures, it is crucial to account for this inherent diversity when developing a learning model. This may involve using a flexible and adaptive approach that can accommodate various seizure patterns.

2. The impact of ignoring certain time intervals after a seizure detection on detection performance: Ignoring a specific amount of time after a seizure detection can significantly improve the detection performance. Hence, incorporating this aspect into the learning model design may yield improved results.

3. Shifting from sample-wise scoring to event-based scoring: A fully implemented system should be based on events, where consecutive positive predictions are consolidated into one seizure event. This would allow for a more accurate evaluation of the model's performance.

4. The need for comprehensive data collection: To account for the diversity in seizure types and patterns across patients, it is essential to collect extensive data from various sources and individuals, ensuring that the learning model can effectively handle a wide range of scenarios.

5. Continuous improvement and refinement: Given the exploratory nature of this approach, ongoing evaluation, analysis, and fine-tuning of the learning model will be necessary to optimize its performance over time.","When designing a learning model for seizure detection using wearable biosignals, account for the heterogeneity of seizures among patients and consider ignoring certain time intervals post-seizure detection to potentially improve performance."
"The former requires multiple seizures recorded per subject and will produce individualized models tailored to a single patient, while the latter requires seizures recorded from multiple different participants and will give inter-subject models, to be used over wider populations. This study aims to de- termine which of these approaches may work best for focal motor seizures going forward, giving guidance for the design of future studies in the field. Following the study classification suggested by Beniczky et al. [212] in 2018, the study presented here could be classified as a phase 1 retrospective proof-of-principle study. The main contribution of this work is the eval- uation of supervised machine learning methodologies on focal onset epileptic motor seizures in a data set recorded from a non-EEG wearable device. A comparison between two evaluation approaches, intra- and inter-subject, provides additional context and facilitates recommenda- tions towards future studies in the field. 5.2.2 Materials and Methods Data Set Data from wearable devices were recorded from a total of 243 patients with epilepsy across two EMUs in the period between July 2017 and February 2020. Both at the neurophysiological department of King’s College Hospital London (KCL) (71/243 patients), and at the Univer- sity Medical Center Freiburg (172/243 patients), patients in the age range of 7 to 80 with a diagnosis of epilepsy were recruited sequentially as part of their standard clinical epilepsy care, for example, in the course of standard presurgical evaluation. Patients with predomi- nantly (suspected) psychogenic non-epileptic seizures or other involuntary movements were not included in the study. As part of their stay in the EMU study, participants may have had seizures provoked, for example, by temporary reduction of their anti-epileptic medication or through other means, such as sleep deprivation or hyperventilation techniques. The vEEG data were retrospectively reviewed and labeled by clinical experts. Primarily, they marked seizure type and semiologies, electrographic and clinical onset and offset, and other metadata including state of vigilance and body position at seizure onset. While participants wore dif- ferent kinds of wearable devices, and sometimes more than one in parallel, the retrospective study presented here only includes data from the wrist-worn Empatica E4 (Figure 5.4; Sec- tion 3.2.1; Empatica Inc., Boston, MA, USA). It is a research-grade device designed specifically for epilepsy seizure detection, recording 3-axis ACC at a sample rate of 32 Hz, EDA at 4 Hz, skin temperature at 4 Hz, and PPG at 64 Hz, the latter of which was internally preprocessed into a blood volume pulse (BVP) signal. The wearable has a European Union Conformité Eu- ropéenne class IIa certification as a medical device. The data recording mode used in this study 106 CHAPTER 5. DETECTION OF FOCAL ONSET SEIZURES Figure 5.4: One of the Empatica E4 wrist-worn wearable devices used in this study (left), and the Android phone application that connects to the wearable via Bluetooth and records the data stream (right). was the online Bluetooth streaming mode. Battery life could range between 12 h to 48 h de- pending on the condition of the battery. Participants were given two devices, such that one would always be recording while the other was charging. The study and recording procedures are further described in Bruno et al. [103] (see Section 3.1) and Ranjan et al. [291]. As part of the study recruitment, all participants gave written informed consent, and the study protocols and consent forms were approved by the local ethics committees (London Fulham Research Ethics Committee — 16/LO/2209; Ethics Committee at the University of Freiburg — 538/16). Feature Set To facilitate the detection of focal motor seizures in this data set of non-EEG wearable data, a selection of derived features are calculated from each of the three raw data modalities. These features are chosen to meaningfully represent the changes in the signal between ictal (seizure) and inter-ictal (non-seizure) phases. Each feature vector is calculated consecutively from the raw time series data at a constant interval of two seconds, regardless of the actual length of the feature window (see Figure 5.5). The choice of features in this study was informed primarily by previous research in the field. The following details the feature calculations for the biosignal modalities, ACC, EDA, and BVP. For the ACC features, a number of parameters calculated from the recurrence plot are used as features. Recurrence plots are a statistical tool to analyze recurrence in time series data [345, 346], and have been successfully used in the detection of motor movements from accelerometer data before [104, 308, 347]. Specifically, the determinism (percentage of points that form diagonal lines of a minimal length), the Shannon entropy (probability that a line 5.2.

Abscissa not to scale. has a certain length), the average diagonal line length, and the recurrence rate (density of recurrence points) were calculated from the recurrence quantification analysis. All of these values are derived from overlapping data windows of a length of 10 s, centered at each 2 s interval. The EDA features used here are calculated from the skin conductance level and the skin conductance response rate (SCRR) [42, 135, 150, 246]. The former is essentially a low-pass filtered version of the original raw EDA signal and thus represents the slower tonic changes in the EDA data. It is represented in the feature set by the difference of area under the curve and maximum between the five minutes before (feature window) and after (baseline) each two-second interval point. Additionally, the SCRR feature is calculated against the baseline in the same way, representing the higher-frequency phasic changes of the EDA signal. The SCRR is calculated as the number of threshold crossings of the first derivative of the EDA signal in the window.",What is the purpose of this study and how does it compare the effectiveness of two approaches for studying focal motor seizures using machine learning methodologies on data from a non-EEG wearable device?,en,"The purpose of this study is to determine which approach – individualized models tailored to a single patient or inter-subject models for wider populations – works best for studying focal motor seizures using machine learning methodologies. This determination is made based on analysis of data from a non-EEG wearable device, recorded from 243 patients with epilepsy across two hospitals over a specific period. The study compares the effectiveness of these approaches by evaluating two different evaluation methods, intra- and inter-subject, providing additional context for future studies in the field.","This study aims to determine the best approach for studying focal motor seizures using machine learning, comparing two methods: individualized models (for single patients) versus inter-subject models (for wider populations). The data is from a non-EEG wearable device."
"Finally, the BVP raw data (derived device-internally from the PPG sensor) are processed to a heart rate (HR) estimation following the procedure described in Glasstetter et al. [348]: A peak tracking algorithm was applied to find local minima in the raw time series [349], and the resulting inter-beat-intervals were processed to the HR estimation employing several filters to produce a smooth and meaningful output. This HR estimation as well as a spectral entropy score representing BVP signal quality [159, 348] was used as feature values. As the BVP signal is highly sensitive to motion artifacts [173], using a signal quality index like this as a feature for classification follows the principle of regarding artifacts as additional information, instead of discarding them outright. Furthermore, this feature can be observed as a sort of indication for the quality of the model; a model that is highly dependent on the data quality of a signal may not be regarded as a particularly stable model. Additionally, the mean and maximum of 108 CHAPTER 5. DETECTION OF FOCAL ONSET SEIZURES the calculated HR feature over a 60 s window are used as features as well, which are baseline- corrected by the difference of values between the feature and baseline window. An overview of the different feature and baseline windows can be found in Figure 5.5. A comprehensive listing of the individual features is shown below: 1. Four features calculated from the recurrence plot of the ACC signal in a 10 s window: (a) Determinism, that is, the percentage of points that form diagonal lines of a min- imal length. (b) The Shannon entropy of the probability that a line has a certain length. (c) The average diagonal line length. (d) Recurrence rate, that is, the density of recurrence points. 2.

(c) The spectral entropy data quality index of the raw BVP signal, sampled at 2 s intervals. (d) The heart rate estimation calculated from the raw BVP signal, sampled at 2 s intervals. Evaluation To assess the possibilities of detecting focal epileptic seizures by wearable biosignal data, two different approaches were investigated: intra-subject and inter-subject. The distinction is an important addition to this work, as focal motor seizures have not been investigated to a degree that allows making the choice outright. While an inter-subject approach, that is, creating models that can detect seizures across a patient population without individual adjustments, would certainly be the best possible outcome, the heterogeneity of focal seizures may dictate an intra-subject approach using individualized models. To examine the effect that this might have with the given data set, the evaluation was divided into two parts. Firstly, a subset of participants with at least three focal motor seizures recorded was iso- lated, and the detection model was evaluated per participant in a parameter-optimized leave- one-seizure-out (LOSO) cross-validation. As the data set did not provide data with more than 5.2. DETECTION OF FOCAL MOTOR SEIZURES 109 six seizures recorded for a single participant, or with multiple independent recordings of a participant, this was performed without a dedicated test set which is truly “out-of-sample”. Rather, the model was trained with the data of all but one seizure and the respective peri- ictal data of 10 min before and after each seizure. These data were standardized using the z-score method before training, and the normalization parameters (centering mean and scal- ing standard deviation) were stored. The resulting model was then tested on the remaining participant data, standardized using the previously stored normalization parameters from the training step. This test data included the complete data set of the participant, including the left-out seizure, but not any of the data used for training the model. Nevertheless, due to the high imbalance between inter-ictal versus ictal phases, the proportion of data between the test and training set was typically far greater than 10:1. This process was repeated such that each seizure of the participant was left out once. Secondly, for the inter-subject evaluation, the seizure data from all the participants with three or more seizures recorded, selected in the first step, were used to validate the per- formance on data from all the remaining participants with one or two focal motor seizures recorded. Thereby, the model was first parameter-optimized in a leave-one-participant-out (LOPO) cross-validation on those training participants. Thus, each of the participants in this optimization set was omitted from the model training process once and used as a validation data set. The mean performance scores over the cross-validation runs were then used to deter- mine the optimal parameter combination. In a second evaluation step, the optimized model, now trained with all the peri-ictal seizure data from the training subjects, was then applied to all the data from the test set participants. During the training of this model, the data were again first standardized using the z-score method, and those normalization parameters were then applied to the incoming test data. Overall this resulted in a model trained and optimized on data from one set of participants, which was then tested on data from another separate set of participants.","What role does the spectral entropy score of the BVP signal play in the classification process, considering its sensitivity to motion artifacts and potential indication of model stability?",en,"The spectral entropy score of the BVP signal plays a significant role in the classification process by providing an assessment of the signal quality, given its high sensitivity to motion artifacts. By considering these artifacts as additional information instead of discarding them outright, it serves as a feature for classification. Furthermore, this score can be viewed as an indication of the quality and potential stability of the model. A model that is highly dependent on the data quality of a signal (in this case, BVP signal) may not be regarded as particularly stable if the spectral entropy score indicates poor quality.","The spectral entropy score of the BVP signal in the classification process indicates quality, as it considers motion artifacts, and can serve as an indication of model stability."
"Classification Model The GBT [95, 309] methodology was chosen as the model used to detect ictal states, as it is rel- atively straightforward in its application and was already validated on the same cohort, albeit on data from patients with convulsive seizures [104] (Section 4.1). Due to this methodology’s requirement for parameter tuning to achieve good performance, hyperparameter optimization was conducted in both the intra- and inter-subject evaluations, as described above. For the optimization of the intra-subject model, an optimal parameter combination was found for each of the three included participants by performing a LOSO cross-validation. Thereby, the model was trained on the data of all but one seizure and the respective peri- ictal data, and tested on all remaining data including the left-out seizure for that participant, minus the training data. This was repeated for all seizures, and the performance scores were averaged. This procedure was then repeated for each combination of parameters. For the inter-subject evaluation, a similar procedure was implemented for the three selected partici- pants, but in a LOPO manner. The model with the best parameter combination was then tested on out-of-sample data from previously unseen participants. Four different model parameters were optimized: the learning rate, the maximum number of weak learners, the maximum tree depth per weak learner, and the misclassification cost for false positives (FPs). Conversely, the misclassification cost for false negatives (FNs) was not tuned and kept unweighted, and only one type of boosting was used, namely adaptive boosting 110 CHAPTER 5. DETECTION OF FOCAL ONSET SEIZURES for binary classification (“AdaBoost”) [310]. In total, the number of different parameter com- binations over which the grid search optimization was performed added up to 600. The best parameter combination was chosen as the one with the highest sensitivity and lowest number of FPs, in that order. In the case of a tie, the parameter combination with a higher learning rate or lower number of trees was chosen as the best one, as it would be computationally more efficient. To gauge the influence of the various features on the creation of the model, the feature importance of each of the optimized models was analyzed. Therefore, the importance scores for each of the models resulting from the single cross-validation runs was averaged in the intra-subject LOSO evaluation, resulting in one set of scores per participant included there. Moreover, for the inter-subject LOPO evaluation, only the importance scores of the optimal model, trained on all seizures from those intra-subject evaluation participants, were noted. The feature importance was based on decision tree node impurity, using the Gini diversity index and calculated such that the smallest possible value was 0 [311, 350]. Thereby, the reported importance scores for each of the features are the averages over all the trained trees in the boosting ensemble for the GBT model. Performance Measurement The main indicators of performance used in this evaluation are the mean sensitivity, false alarm rate (FAR) per 24 h (false alarm rate per 24 h (FAR24)) and positive predictive value (PPV). These scores were calculated from the number of overlaps of seizure events in the ground truth and predicted labels. The label data, analogous to the feature data, were stored at 2 s intervals, and seizure events here were defined as consecutive intervals of labels classified as a seizure of at least 6 s and at most 10 min. The output of the classification model was furthermore smoothed before this scoring computation, by filling out gaps between seizure labels of at most 30 s, and removing any orphan seizure labels. After this processing of the model output, it was compared to the ground truth and any overlaps of seizure events were counted as true positives. Seizure events in the ground truth but not in the detector output were counted as FNs, and vice versa, seizure events in the output that were not present in the ground truth were counted as FPs. Note that the comparisons described above are given a 2 min margin before and after seizure events in the ground truth, wherein overlaps with detected events still count as true positives. This was performed to account for some of the uncertainty related to seizure manifestations, as well as the in-hospital setting providing a certain degree of nurse intervention after a seizure. True negatives were not counted in this evaluation, as they do not give any more worthwhile information for performance measurement. The false alarm rate per night (FARn) calculates the FAR during a standard 8 h night between 23:00 and 07:00. Thereby, the number of false alarms produced by the model occurring during that time period were counted, and divided by the number of hours that were recorded during these nights, taking into account any data loss that may have occurred during these hours. The FARn was therefore calculated as: FARn = number of FPs during night · hours per night nightly hours recorded (5.1) All data analysis, feature extraction, and performance evaluation was implemented using MATLAB R2021b (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). 5.2.

Data Set Selection The complete data set of wearable data from 243 patients with epilepsy was filtered to include only data relevant to the premise of this study. Figure 5.6 visualizes the data set selection process, and Table 5.4 lists clinical and demographic information of the finally selected par- ticipants.","What methodology was used to optimize the Classification Model for detecting ictal states, and how was the optimal parameter combination determined for each participant?",en,"The methodology used to optimize the Classification Model for detecting ictal states was a process of hyperparameter optimization. For the intra-subject model, an optimal parameter combination was found for each participant by performing Leave-One-Seizure-Out (LOSO) cross-validation. In this process, the model was trained on the data of all but one seizure and the respective peri-ictal data, then tested on all remaining data including the left-out seizure for that participant, minus the training data. This was repeated for all seizures, and the performance scores were averaged. The process was then repeated for each combination of parameters to find the best one. For the inter-subject evaluation, a similar procedure was implemented for the selected participants but in a Leave-One-Participant-Out (LOPO) manner, and the model with the best parameter combination was then tested on out-of-sample data from previously unseen participants. Four different model parameters were optimized: the learning rate, the maximum number of weak learners, the maximum tree depth per weak learner, and the misclassification cost for false positives (FPs). The model without optimization would not have been able to achieve good performance.","The Grid Search methodology was used to optimize the Classification Model. For each participant, an optimal parameter combination was found by performing Leave-One-Seizure-Out cross-validation."
"First, only data from those participants who had at least one focal seizure recorded that involved tonic or clonic motor manifestations were included. Thereby, these manifesta- tions could co-occur with other seizure manifestations; however, focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures were excluded. Moreover, the data set was not filtered further by overlap of symptom location versus device location. Therefore, the data set can, for example, include instances of motor seizures that manifest primarily on the right-hand side, but where the wearable device was attached to the left wrist. Excluding these seizure instances would substantially reduce the number of seizures and included participants for the analysis presented here, especially for the inter-subject evaluation, to the point of impracticality. During the study recordings, the Empatica E4 device was used in a Bluetooth streaming mode [103], which unfortunately led to a considerable loss of data due to regular problems with connectivity of the wearable device to a base device that stores the data. Thereby, more than 50 % of the potential data to be recorded, and correspondingly as many potential seizures, were lost, leading to a substantially reduced number of relevant focal motor seizures recorded for this study. Furthermore, the data set was filtered for total length of recording per partic- ipant, where only those recordings with at least 24 h of data were included, and for length of seizures, where only those seizures with a duration between 10 s and 10 min are included. Limiting the duration of seizures excludes very short seizures of just a few seconds, such as myoclonic seizures, and very long seizures, such as status epilepticus. This is performed to exclude outliers and to have defined limits of duration within which to detect potential seizure events. 112 CHAPTER 5.

Lastly, the data quality during all remaining seizures was visually checked, and specifically those with bad EDA signal quality were excluded. A poor EDA signal can either be a flat zero- line, indicating loss of contact of the electrodes with the skin, or multiple periods of high rates of amplitude change, indicating a loosely fitting device. The BVP raw signal was specifically not filtered for signal quality, firstly because it would filter out nearly every remaining seizure due to its high susceptibility to motion artifacts, and secondly because the feature set for this evaluation indeed includes a data quality index as a feature itself. 5.2.3 Results Data Set and Examples The resulting data set used for this evaluation thus included 20 relevant seizures from a total of nine study participants. 44 % (4 of 9) of the participants were female, and participants had a mean age of 45 years (range 9 to 69 years) at study enrollment. Three of these participants had more than two seizures recorded for a total of twelve seizures (Table 5.5), and the data from these were thus used for the intra-subject evaluation, as well as the training set for the LOPO cross-validation in the inter-subject evaluation. The remaining six participants had either one or two seizures recorded, for a total of eight seizures included in the inter-subject evaluation test set. The mean recording length per participant in this data set was 83.2 h (range 35.8 h to 127.6 h). To give a better overview of the three participants with multiple seizures recorded and used in the intra-subject evaluation, Figure 5.7 presents one example seizure for each of these participants. Participant UKF1 had six seizures recorded with the wearable device, all of them focal onset motor seizures with tonic and clonic manifestations, ictal tachycardia, and im- paired awareness. Furthermore, all of these seizures occurred while the patient was sleeping in his hospital bed, and all have a characteristic progression. Overall, these seizure symptoms are the most similar to focal to bilateral or generalized tonic-clonic seizures in the data set, yet noticeably lack the severity of the larger seizures, both regarding the vEEG and also the movements captured with the ACC signal. 5.2.

Seizures shown are: (a) UKF1-4; (b) UKF2-3; (c) and KCL1-3 (see Table 5.5). Due to the grace period of 2 min around a seizure event, the detection for KCL1-3 counts as a true positive.","Why was it deemed necessary to include instances of motor seizures that might not have been directly monitored by the wearable device in the analysis presented here, despite potential data loss issues related to Bluetooth streaming mode?",en,"The inclusion of instances of motor seizures that might not have been directly monitored by the wearable device was deemed necessary because excluding these seizure instances would substantially reduce the number of seizures and included participants for analysis, especially for the inter-subject evaluation, to the point of impracticality. This is due to the fact that the data set was not filtered further by overlap of symptom location versus device location, meaning that even if a motor seizure manifests primarily on one side but the wearable device is attached to another, it would still be included in the analysis. This broad inclusion criterion allows for a more comprehensive study of the data available, despite potential data loss issues related to Bluetooth streaming mode.","To ensure a practical number of seizures for inter-subject evaluation, instances of motor seizures, regardless of device location, were included. This reduced the potential data loss impact due to Bluetooth streaming issues."
"Each plot of a seizure shows the raw ACC signal (top), the raw EDA signal and feature 2b (middle), and the estimated heart rate and signal quality index of the BVP signal (bottom). The regions highlighted in red mark the ground truth as labeled by experts, those highlighted in green mark the seizure intervals as predicted by the respective model. The seizure onset and offset are additionally marked by the black vertical bars. All signals shown are normalized between −1 and 1 only for these plots. 5.2. DETECTION OF FOCAL MOTOR SEIZURES 115 UKF2, on the other hand, had three focal onset motor seizures recorded with only tonic manifestations, ictal tachycardia, and miscellaneous awareness during the seizure. Notably though, all seizures occurred while the patient was awake. Another important distinguishing factor for this participant is that he was only nine years old at the time of enrollment, and as such the only pediatric patient in the relevant data sets regarded here. Epilepsy in pediatric patients generally manifests in different ways than for adults [23]. The sole data set from the KCL site, KCL1, had three seizures recorded that match the criteria for the seizure type. The motor manifestations for them were more heterogeneous than for the other two participants. All had tonic components, but there were also some oral automatisms, and one seizure also had clonic components. Furthermore, one seizure did not prompt ictal tachycardia, and there was a high variance between the seizure durations, with one being over 2 min and occurring while awake, and the other two only 22 s, occurring from sleep. Aside from the movements during the seizures, Figure 5.7 also gives a good overview of the typical EDA and BVP responses in the data, which can be observed most clearly in the first presented seizure UKF1-4. The EDA signal shows a clear response to the seizure, and the cor- responding feature, the difference in the maximum of the skin conductance level, accordingly is at its highest during the seizure. The heart rate estimated from the BVP sensor signal also clearly demonstrates some response after the seizure onset for all three examples; however, at the same time, the signal quality also drops substantially, and as such the estimated heart rate should not be regarded as representative for these periods. Intra-Subject Evaluation Data from three participants were selected for the intra-subject evaluation. One patient was se- lected from the London cohort with three seizures recorded (KCL1), and two from the Freiburg cohort with six (UKF1) and three (UKF2) seizures recorded, respectively. Out of these twelve seizures, only one seizure, of participant UKF2, could not be identified in the individual opti- mized LOSO evaluation. All other seizures were consistently detected in the complete partic- ipant data by the optimized models, when trained on the other seizures of the respective par- ticipant. In terms of FAR however, the methodology exhibited vastly different performances over the three participants. The cross-validation runs for participant UKF1 showed the lowest number of false positives at just three on average, ranging from 1 to 5 depending on which of the seizures was left out for testing. Overall, this resulted in a low FAR of less than one per 24 h (0.85/24 h). For the other two cases, the FAR was considerably higher, at almost two per hour for UKF2 (41.5/24 h) and somewhat less than one per hour for KCL1 (17.7/24 h), on average. An overview of the per-participant results of this evaluation can be found in Table 5.6 under “Intra-Subject Evaluation”. Inter-Subject Evaluation To assess the performance of seizure detection across multiple patients, the GBT model was first trained using the peri-ictal seizure data of the 12 seizures from the three participants men- tioned above. The model was thereby parameter-optimized in a LOPO manner, as explained in Section 5.2.2. In this cross-validation, the model with the best-performing parameter combina- tion was able to recognize a total of eight of the twelve seizures (overall sensitivity 67 %, mean 72 %, and range 50 % to 100 %) in the validation set, with a mean FAR of approximately one 116 CHAPTER 5.

The resulting model was then applied to the complete data sets of six other participants, in- cluding a total of eight epileptic focal motor seizures. In this out-of-sample test set, the model was overall able to detect six of the eight seizures (overall sensitivity 75 %, mean 75 %, and range 0 % to 100 %) with a mean FAR of 13.4/24 h (range 4.4/24 h to 22.7/24 h). Table 5.6 shows a summary of these across-participant results under “Inter-Subject Evaluation”.","What are the specific distinguishing factors for the participant UKF2 who had three focal onset motor seizures recorded, and how does his case differ from others in the relevant data sets regarding age and seizure characteristics?",en,"The specific distinguishing factors for participant UKF2 are that he had three focal onset motor seizures recorded, with only tonic manifestations, ictal tachycardia, and miscellaneous awareness during the seizure. Notably, all these seizures occurred while he was awake. Another important difference is that he was nine years old at the time of enrollment, making him the only pediatric patient in the relevant data sets considered here. Epilepsy in pediatric patients generally manifests differently than for adults, as suggested by research [23]. Regarding seizure characteristics, the motor manifestations for UKF2 were more heterogeneous compared to others, with tonic components, oral automatisms, and one seizure had clonic components. One seizure did not prompt ictal tachycardia, and there was a high variance between his seizures.","UKF2 is a pediatric patient (9 years old), which differentiates him from other participants. His seizures were characterized by tonic manifestations, oral automatisms, and occasional clonic components, with varying levels of awareness. Unlike others, not all his seizures showed ictal tachycardia. This case is unique as it comes from the only pediatric data set in the relevant sets studied."
"Feature Importance The feature importance for each of the three optimal models trained on data from the three per-subject evaluation participants was calculated as outlined in Section 5.2.2. Figure 5.8 shows these importance scores per participant and feature, and the mean scores of each feature group by modality. These feature scores are unit-less and can be interpreted qualitatively to deter- mine whether some specific feature or general modality is contributing more than the others. Here, the EDA features were more influential than the others in the two participants UKF1 and KCL1. Conversely, the BVP features were unexpectedly more meaningful for the model of participant UKF2 than the other two modalities. The same kind of feature importance scores for the inter-subject model trained on all three of these participants for the inter-subject eval- uation can be found in Figure 5.8d. Here, the EDA features turned out to be more important than the others. 5.2.4 Discussion Principal Findings The main ambition of the evaluation presented here was to qualitatively assess the utility of multimodal biosignal data from wearables in creating worthwhile and robust seizure detec- tion systems. Thereby, two principal avenues of potential study design were investigated: intra-subject and inter-subject schemes. Specifically, this evaluation focuses on focal motor seizures with tonic or clonic components, as opposed to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. These focal seizures have a multitude of possible physical and psychological manifestations that can occur in sequence or in parallel, be repeated, or not occur at all, in a single seizure. Further- more, while there may oftentimes be little change in the semiology of seizures for a single patient with epilepsy, they can be very heterogeneous across populations [27, 255]. These circumstances are also reflected in these results. Among the three participants with at least three seizures recorded, the individually optimized model could robustly recover the left-out seizures in the leave-one-seizure-out cross-validation for two participants. In one other participant, however, out of three seizures, one could not be restored by the model when trained on the other two (Table 5.5 and Figure 5.9). These three seizures had roughly the same semiology with tonic manifestations and ictal tachycardia. In the wearable data, however, one clear difference can be found between this undetected seizure and the other two; that is, it showed no discernible EDA response before, during, or after the seizure. Addi- tionally, this participant UKF2 had an important demographic difference to all other included participants in this data set, in that they were the only pediatric patient at nine years old. Age has been linked, for example, to significant changes in seizure semiologies [23]. These circumstances likely led to this specific seizure falling out of the scope of this methodology. 118 CHAPTER 5.

Data shown from top to bottom: raw ACC, raw EDA and feature 2b, heart rate and BVP signal quality index. The red overlay is the seizure ground truth. The seizure onset and offset are additionally marked by the black vertical bars. All signals shown are normalized between −1 and 1 only for these plots. These results suggest that a methodology such as the one presented here, optimized on individual participants, can robustly detect seizures for some patients with epilepsy, but it may fail, especially when the seizures have differing semiologies that are not represented in the training data for the model. Furthermore, when looking at the FAR24 and PPV, the het- erogeneity of focal seizure detection is especially highlighted. The FAR24 performance of the seizure detection, ranging from less than one FP per day to almost two FP per hour, is an im- portant factor when it comes to actually applying the methodology to a real-world setting. Similarly, this false alarm rate also carries over to the nighttime, with multiple false positives per night for some participants. Thus, a high sensitivity in detecting seizures is in vain if an automated seizure diary is filled with dozens of false seizure events per day. Yet, further data recordings and model optimization may produce robust seizure detection systems for individ- ual patients. With respect to the inter-subject evaluation across multiple study participants, the results for the methodology applied here further demonstrate the heterogeneity of the focal motor seizures in this data set, and clearly demonstrate the resulting difficulties. Inter-subject mod- els applied in a leave-one-participant-out manner to data of the three selected participants from the intra-subject evaluation performed worse than if trained in an individualized man- ner, either in terms of sensitivity or FAR. Likewise, testing the model on out-of-sample data of six other participants resulted in a tolerable sensitivity but a high FAR and low PPV. A model such as this would be ineffective in real-world settings, be it as an automated seizure diary or an alarm system, and patients’ and caregivers’ needs, in particular, would not be fulfilled [72, 130, 131]. Overall, the results suggest that not only are focal onset motor seizures varied in their clin- ical manifestations, they are also sensitive to changes in common wearable biosignal modal- ities, when investigated across patients. However, in some individual patients, seizure semi- ologies are similar enough across seizures to enable robust seizure detection models for less- severe focal onset motor seizures, if the models are optimized in a personalized manner. 120 CHAPTER 5.","What is the principal finding regarding feature importance from the inter-subject evaluation participants as shown in Figure 5.8d, and how does it compare to the findings from each of the three optimal models trained on data from the individual participants?",en,"The principal finding regarding feature importance from the inter-subject evaluation participants, as shown in Figure 5.8d, indicates that the EDA features were more important than the others. This finding is consistent with the results from two of the three optimal models trained on data from individual participants (UKF1 and KCL1), where EDA features were also more influential. However, for participant UKF2, the BVP features were found to be unexpectedly more meaningful for the model compared to the other modalities, which was not observed in the inter-subject evaluation or the results from the other two participants.","The principal finding from the inter-subject evaluation (Figure 5.8d) shows that EDA features were more important compared to others. This aligns with two out of three individual participants (UKF1, KCL1), but contrasts the case of participant UKF2 where BVP features were more meaningful for the model."
"DETECTION OF FOCAL ONSET SEIZURES Related Work To compare the results presented here to some of the current and past state-of-the-art seizure detection studies, a list of twelve related works featuring focal motor seizures in some form in their set of analyzed seizure types was compiled (Table 5.7). The main source of this list was the extensive literature review by Beniczky et al. [109], filtered for relevant seizure types and relevant biosignal modalities that are most closely related to the modalities ACC, EDA, and PPG. Furthermore, to add some variety, the list includes two recent studies employing wear- able electromyography- and EEG-based focal seizure detection. All three of the performance measures included here are compared, namely sensitivity, FAR24, and PPV. However, as most of these works include focal motor seizures as part of a larger group of seizure types, almost always dominated by generalized and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, the list only in- cludes three studies where this was possible for all three measures [74, 227, 341]. All three of these studies classify the focal onset seizures in their respective data sets as complex partial seizures (CPSs), which is an older type of epileptic seizure classification meaning an interval with ictal impaired awareness without giving information about motor manifestations during the seizures. Therefore, it is unclear if, with respect to movements during the seizures, the seizure types investigated in these works are comparable to those in the study presented here. Moreover, all three studies evaluated their seizure detection in an inter-subject manner across a population of patients with epilepsy. Summarizing the relevant results from these three works, Cogan et al. [227] used a com- bination of two different wearable devices to record the biosignal modalities EDA, electro- cardiography (ECG), and blood oxygen saturation, and reported an algorithm sensitivity of 50 % with a false alarm rate of 0.28/24 h, in CPS only. Notably, during their analysis they also looked into personalization of their algorithm, and concluded that a minimum of 6 to 8 seizures per patient would be required to sufficiently train and optimize their algorithm parameters, based on a worst-case scenario. Kusmakar et al. [341] employed ACC sensors in a leave-one- participant-out inter-subject evaluation and reported a sensitivity of 67 % and a FAR24 of 4, regarding the participants with CPS. They duly concluded that these seizures are much more similar to inter-ictal data than they are to ictal generalized tonic-clonic seizure data, and as their data set included only a very small number of CPS, a good performance on this seizure type was not to be expected. Lastly, Vandecasteele et al. [74] compared two wearable devices recording ECG and PPG, respectively, and reported an overall sensitivity of 32 % with a FAR24 of 43.2 for the PPG-based wearable device, which was the same as the one used in this study. They concluded that the PPG-based detection was heavily impeded by motion artifacts even for these possibly non-generalized seizures. Comparing these performances, and further results from other related work which did not report their outcomes per seizure type or per participant (Table 5.7), to this study’s results (Table 5.6), it becomes clear that a sensitivity of 75 % in an independent test set of focal motor seizures is in fact among the top performing methodologies regarding this seizure type only. Furthermore, works that reported lower numbers of false positive rates also consistently had lower sensitivities, and some studies that reported similar numbers nevertheless still had lower sensitivities. Overall, a comparison of this study’s results to any of these works should be taken with caution, as this study specifically analyzes focal motor seizures with multi-modal non-EEG wearable data. 5.2.

DETECTION OF FOCAL ONSET SEIZURES Modality Importance Overall, the distributions of feature importance scores, as a proxy for the importance of biosig- nal modalities, seem to be heterogeneous, and no clear winner could be found among the three examples. The features calculated from the EDA signal, however, seem to be the most informative with respect to epileptic seizure phases, within this data set of focal onset motor seizures.","What is the primary source for the compilation of the list of 12 related works in this study that focuses on the detection of focal onset seizures, and how are the performance measures of sensitivity, FAR24, and PPV compared across these studies?",en,"La principale source de compilation de la liste de 12 études liées dans cette étude sur la détection des focal onset seizures est l'examen exhaustif effectué par Beniczky et al. [109]. Ces études sont filtrées en fonction des types de crises épileptiques pertinentes et des modalités biologiques les plus proches des modalités ACC, EDA, et PPG. La comparaison des mesures de performance de sensibilité, FAR24, et PPV est effectuée dans ces études. Cependant, la plupart de ces études incluent souvent des crises focales moteurs en tant qu'élément d'un ensemble plus large de types de crises épileptiques, dominés généralement par les crises généralisées et focal to bilateral tonic-cloniques. Par conséquent, la liste ne comprend que trois études où cela a été possible pour toutes les mesures [74, 227, 341]. Ces études classifient les crises de début focal dans leurs ensembles de données respectifs comme des complex partial seizures (CPSs), une ancienne classification de types d'épilepsie. Ainsi, il est incertain si, dans le contexte des mouvements pendant les crises, les types de crises étudiés dans ces études correspondent aux mêmes types de crises en termes de manifestations moteures pendant les crises.","The primary source for the compilation of the list is Beniczky et al. [109]. Sensitivity, FAR24, and PPV are compared across the studies to assess their performance in detecting focal onset seizures. However, only three studies meet the criteria for all three measures."
"This is concurrent with some prior research on generalized seizures as well [223, 293, 351, 352], and suggests that electrodermal activity could be an important clinical marker of epileptic seizures beyond highly convulsive episodes, which usually induce heavy sweat- ing. However, it is not a universally applicable biomarker, as these results also suggest, with at least one participant and several seizures exhibiting no substantial (post-)ictal EDA response, as was also concluded in further literature on the topic [42, 43, 105]. In Glasstetter et al. [348], the authors explored the utility of wearable PPG signals for the detection of focal onset seizures with ictal tachycardia, and concluded that in some patients the tachycardia thresholds can be found regardless of seizure-related movements. It seems to be the case that in some seizures the ictal tachycardia presents itself some few seconds before the electrographic seizure onset, and could therefore be used as indicators for seizures, albeit not effectively in a monomodal system. The authors, however, also noted that arbitrary non- seizure-related movements may hinder this detection from PPG signals due to motion artifacts, and generally pre-ictal tachycardia seems to be an isolated phenomenon not generalizable over patient cohorts. The results presented here coincide with these conclusions, demonstrating that BVP features are important only for one of three patients with at least three seizures recorded. Limitations The main limitation of the study and analysis presented here is the limited size of the data set, with just 20 seizures recorded from nine patients with epilepsy. Unfortunately, publicly available data sets focusing on classical wrist-worn wearable data which combine movement and autonomous nervous system biosignals are scarce as it is, and practically nonexistent in the field of epilepsy research. To be considered a useful supplement to the data collected here, a public data set would need to provide at least ACC, EDA, and BVP data recorded from a wrist-worn wearable in a cohort of patients with epilepsy, and at least EEG seizure onset and offset would need to be labeled by experts. Such a data set does not currently exist publicly. The relatively small size of the data set used here is also the main reason the methodology used “classical” supervised machine learning with a set of specifically tailored features as opposed to some deep learning methodology. Deep learning may, however, be an avenue to pursue in a later study, with a more extensive data set. As the seizure types regarded here were carefully chosen, a large percentage of the overall recorded seizures were not eligible for inclusion. Furthermore, during their usually week-long stay at the epilepsy monitoring units, patients rarely had more than a few seizures in the first place, as seizure provocation was often conducted only for a limited time until enough seizures had been observed to serve some clinical purpose. This lead to a generally low number of study participants with more than two seizures recorded, a necessary minimum requirement for any kind of analysis of personalized, intra-subject evaluations. Future research may include more seizures and seizure types from the already recorded data set, but new studies need to be conceptualized to aim for higher numbers of seizures recorded per participant, not just over 5.2. DETECTION OF FOCAL MOTOR SEIZURES 123 the whole cohort, in order to push focal seizure detection research to produce better, more realistically applicable results [130]. Another limitation of this study, as well as many other related works, was the confine- ment of participants to a hospital room throughout the data recording procedures. The data collected and analyzed here cannot be regarded as representative of real-world situations, and new ambulatory studies with a prospective goal of recording focal onset seizures with wearables from patients in their daily living environment are needed. However, even with generalized tonic-clonic seizures as a target, these phase 3 and 4 studies are still rare, and potential methodologies and pitfalls need first be explored in these in-hospital studies before worthwhile out-of-hospital studies can be designed. 5.2.5 Conclusions Seizure detection for focal onset seizures without generalization by means of wearable non- EEG devices is a so far little-researched problem. This study demonstrated that for those seizures in this category with tonic or clonic movements, that is, those closest in semiology to generalized tonic-clonic seizures, robustly detecting seizures from wearable data may be possible for individual patients with epilepsy, depending on their specific seizure manifesta- tion. Overall, electrodermal activity signals seem to provide the most informative features for seizure detection, suggesting it to be an essential part of any future seizure detection re- search. Detection across patients with purely inter-subject models without personalization was, however, not possible to a worthwhile degree, at least with the methodology and data set presented here. Both a low sensitivity that misses a quarter or more of the seizures and high false alarm rates in the order of one per hour make current results of these inter-subject models ineffective for clinical applications. This study’s results thus demonstrated that indi- vidualized models are needed to robustly detect focal onset seizures, and future research in this domain should include at least some degree of personalization in the modeling process. 124 CHAPTER 5. DETECTION OF FOCAL ONSET SEIZURES 5.3 Summary This chapter explored and evaluated the automatic detection of focal motor seizures by way of multimodal biosignal data from wearables. Focal seizures (FSs) are the most predominant seizure type in the general population and can have a multitude of different symptoms, rang- ing from movement of the limbs over tachycardia to sensory feelings. However, FSs are also typically less convulsive than their generalized-onset siblings, with some seizure types not including movement semiology at all. Thus, they are considered to be less unambiguously de- tectable with signals from wearable sensors like accelerometry (ACC), electrodermal activity (EDA), or blood volume pulse (BVP). Still, some types of FSs exhibit characteristic patterns both in movement and response of the autonomous nervous system, so a robust detection is not necessarily impossible. In an exploratory investigation of focal motor seizures, the first part of this chapter high- lighted their extreme heterogeneity in terms of semiology relevant to seizure detection with data from wearables.","What potential clinical markers for epileptic seizures can be identified beyond convulsive episodes, and in what cases might wearable PPG signals and ictal tachycardia present as indicators of seizure onset?",en,"Potential clinical markers for epileptic seizures beyond convulsive episodes that have been suggested include electrodermal activity (EDA) and ictal tachycardia. In some cases, wearable PPG signals might present as an indicator of seizure onset, particularly in patients experiencing focal onset seizures with ictal tachycardia. However, it should be noted that these markers are not universally applicable and may not be effective in a monomodal system due to factors such as motion artifacts or individual variability within patient cohorts. Additionally, pre-ictal tachycardia seems to be an isolated phenomenon not generalizable over all patients.","Electrodermal activity and ictal tachycardia can potentially serve as clinical markers for epileptic seizures beyond convulsive episodes. In some cases, wearable PPG signals may indicate seizure onset with ictal tachycardia appearing a few seconds before electrographic seizure onset, but this is not universally applicable and may be affected by motion artifacts or pre-ictal tachycardia being an isolated phenomenon."
"Focal motor seizures can manifest in characteristic tonic or clonic move- ments of the limbs as much as in random automatisms of the mouth or in exceedingly brief jerks of the whole body, oftentimes indistinguishable in the ACC signal from other non- epileptic movements. The study illustrates a core problem of seizure detection, the high vari- ance in focal seizure manifestations, by evaluating a detection model on FSs from three differ- ent patients. While it performs acceptable on seizures with characteristic movement patterns of the limbs, it fails on other movements and those not manifesting in the limbs. This ex- ploratory study represents a first glimpse into the conclusion of the subsequent part of the chapter, and parts of the eventual conclusion of this thesis. That conclusion results from the final data analysis study in the context of this thesis, namely, that robustly detecting focal onset motor seizures with tonic or clonic movements from wearable data may be possible for individuals, depending on specific seizure manifes- tations. Based on the experiences of the previous studies, this study includes 20 focal motor seizures from 9 patients and evaluates both a patient-individual and a patient-agnostic ap- proach. The detection methodology was similar to the one used in the convulsive seizure detection in Section 4.1, but with a new set of ACC, EDA, and BVP features. It achieved sensitivities of 67 % to 100 % and false alarm rates of down to 0.85/24 h for individualized detection models in three patients. Across patients, it reaches comparable sensitivity, how- ever, false alarm rates are much higher, to the point of being impracticable for useful seizure detection systems. Viewing both parts of this chapter in the context of automatic seizure alerts, it becomes clear that this problem is still to be solved, as multiple false alerts per day up to and beyond one per hour are unrealistic to be accepted by users. Furthermore, other related research reports similar performances across different combinations of focal seizure types, detection strategies, and biosignal modalities. Viewing this research in the context of automated seizure diaries, however, may be more interesting for the time being. For that purpose exceptional performance may not be the deciding factor, since the discovery of qualitative changes in seizure frequencies can already be an important outcome for clinicians to be able to help their patients. And as long as the detection model can reliably detect even just a portion of the occurring seizures, a robust qualitative assessment may be within reach.

CONCLUSION W earable devices are a relatively new and promising tool to enable the remote, unob- trusive, and automated detection of epileptic seizures with multimodal non-electroen- cephalography (EEG) biosignal data. Affecting over 70 million people worldwide, with up to 100 new cases per 100,000 people per year [14], epilepsy is one of the most prevalent chronic neurological disorders. The severity of epileptic seizures can vary tremendously, ranging from major convulsive seizures accompanied by unconsciousness and a heightened risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), to minor second-long jerks or a short sensory aura. Yet, the current gold standard of diagnosing, monitoring, and treating epilepsy are short visits to an epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) at a hospital and undergoing video-electroencephalography recordings, with doctors provoking seizures by various different means in the hopes of cap- turing enough information to advise treatment. At home, between visits to the EMU, patients sometimes keep handwritten diaries of their seizures, noting down the approximate time and symptoms. However, due to the nature of epileptic seizures often involving an impairment of awareness or loss of consciousness, these manual diaries typically severely underestimate the amount and severity of seizures. This thesis investigated the utility of wearable devices for the ultra-long-term monitoring of patients with epilepsy, potentially improving their quality of life by enabling an automated way of keeping seizure diaries, and thus facilitating new and better treatments and lessening the burden of uncontrollable seizure events. Wearable devices like smartwatches or activity trackers will often record a variety of biosignals that are relevant to the health and safety of their users. Among the potential modal- ities recorded are movement by accelerometry (ACC), changes in the autonomic nervous sys- tem by electrodermal activity (EDA), and the heart rate by photoplethysmography measure- ments. It is conceivable that epileptic seizures, especially major convulsive seizures and those with other motor manifestations of the limbs, can be detected automatically via changes in these signals. Indeed, there has been more and more research into this capability in the past ten years, making great strides towards autonomous, ambulatory, and abiding seizure detec- tion with wearable devices.","How might one improve a detection model for identifying focal onset motor seizures that exhibit variability in their manifestations, particularly those without characteristic movement patterns in the limbs?",en,"To improve a detection model for identifying focal onset motor seizures with variable manifestations, especially those not exhibiting characteristic movement patterns in the limbs, several strategies could be considered:

1. Expand the feature set: Incorporate additional physiological signals like EEG, EMG (electromyography), or video data if available to better capture the diverse manifestations of seizures.

2. Utilize machine learning algorithms with adaptive capabilities: Select machine learning techniques that can learn and adapt to new patterns in the data over time, such as online learning methods, reinforcement learning, or deep learning models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

3. Employ ensemble methods: Combine multiple detection models to improve the overall performance and robustness of the system. This can help account for the inherent variability in seizure manifestations by leveraging diverse perspectives and approaches.

4. Collect more and diverse data: Gather seizure data from a broader range of patients, including those with atypical seizure presentations, to train the model to better recognize various seizure types.

5. Implement patient-specific and patient-agnostic approaches: Develop models that can adapt to individual patients' specific seizure patterns (patient-individual approach) as well as generic models applicable to a wider range of patients (patient-agnostic approach). This can help improve the model's ability to identify seizures across different individuals.

6. Optimize model parameters: Tune hyperparameters, thresholds, and decision boundaries to minimize false alarms while maximizing sensitivity for focal motor seizures with less typical manifestations.","To enhance a model for detecting focal onset motor seizures with variable manifestations, focus on incorporating diverse features like ACC, EDA, and BVP that can capture non-limb movements or brief jerks. Additionally, consider a patient-agnostic approach to cater to a wide range of seizure presentations."
"Nevertheless, this is still a relatively young field of study, and the amount of research that has gone into designing and evaluating different methodologies of wearable seizure detection is still in need of augmentation. This thesis compiled and framed several contributions of the author concerning the detection of epileptic motor seizures with multimodal non-EEG data from wearables. 127 Overall, the research topics presented in this thesis can be summarized to several key contributions, expressed along the investigations of Chapters 3 – 5: Data Collection With Wearables: As a foundation for the subsequent data analysis studies, an extensive data set of biosignal data from wearables needed to be collected in a cohort of patients with epilepsy. An open data set of such data containing recorded epileptic seizures did not exist, so a total of 243 participants at two European epilepsy centers were recruited during their routine stay in an EMU. More than 300 seizures of various types were recorded with a wrist-worn research-grade wearable device (Empatica E4), including expert-labelled seizure onset and offset as well as other relevant metadata. Contributions include the dissemination of study design and procedure experiences, the implementation and setup of a local data collection architecture by way of an open- source mobile health platform1, and the resolution of several data issues like timestamp synchronization. Detection of Convulsive Seizures: A novel methodology employing features from ACC and EDA biosignals with an ensemble supervised machine learning model was devel- oped for the automated detection of convulsive tonic-clonic seizures (TCSs). The tech- nique could correctly classify 91 % of the seizure events in an out-of-sample test set of 11 seizures from 2 participants in different cohorts. Further, a false alarm rate of 0.19/24 h in 78 days of data places the methodology at the same or better level than other TCS detection methodologies employing multimodal non-EEG wearables. In a different anal- ysis, a heuristic ACC-based detector of cessation of movement after convulsive seizures was developed. It was able to correctly classify 100 % of the 22 post-ictal events in 18 study participants, including two cases that showed post-ictal agitation, the opposite of the post-ictal immobility that is typically experienced after a TCS. Both works could be combined into a warning system for increased risk of SUDEP, but further optimization concerning the seizure detection latency is necessary. Still, by themselves the contri- butions show that monitoring convulsive epileptic seizures with multimodal wearable devices is feasible with high robustness. Detection of Focal Seizures: While the detection of convulsive seizures leaned on the dis- tinctive and extreme impact those seizures have on the biosignals recorded with wear- ables, the detection of focal seizures (FSs), even of those with movement manifestations, is more ambiguous. Two contributions explore the variety of motor manifestations in FSs and the impact of this circumstance on the feasibility of detection with wearable device data. FSs can be characteristic in individual patients, but are typically not com- parable across patients, reflected in the result of patient-specific detection models per- forming overall better than those evaluated within entire cohorts. Related work on this topic is limited in number, and often needs to be dissected for results on specific FS types, as they are considered in combination with convulsive seizures more often than not. Yet, the contributions presented here show that there is substantial need for the automated detection of FSs from wearables, and current research shows ample promise that this is within reach. 1radar-base.org 128 CHAPTER 6. CONCLUSION In summary, this thesis presents research regarding the detection of epileptic seizures with multimodal non-EEG data from wearables. Specifically, those seizures with manifestations in- cluding movements of the limbs were investigated, and detection systems based on supervised ensemble machine learning using physiological biosignal data were found to be feasible. The remaining sections of this final chapter will compile some additional lessons learned from the experiences made during the work on this thesis, and give an outlook on several aspects and issues to be tackled in the field of seizure detection with wearable devices. 6.1 Practical Lessons Learned During the course of working on this thesis several worthwhile experiences were made with regard to epilepsy and wearable research. This section aims to impart some valuable lessons learned from those experiences that have not been specifically discussed elsewhere in the text. They may guide the design of new clinical studies and further research, as also discussed in Section 6.2. This meta-analysis does not communicate systematical, scientific research that has been published, but reflects the views and opinions of the author of this thesis. 6.1.1 Diversity of Epileptic Seizures The extreme heterogeneity of epileptic seizures, especially those of focal onset without gener- alization, has been discussed in this thesis on various occasions. One aspect that has not been discussed further, however, is the clinical classification of epileptic seizures that is presented in Fisher et al. [27]. While this newest practical classification of seizures has made great strides in removing ambiguity in the naming of seizure types in a clinical context, there is still a lack of compatibility with respect to the classification from non-electroencephalography wearable data. Of course, that was not the purpose of this terminology (re-)assessment, but it brings up the issue of whether a supplementary taxonomy of seizures by their physiological semiol- ogy closer to what wearables may capture may be necessary. As it stands, the classification used universally by published studies both in general epilepsy research and in research con- cerning wearable systems is predominantly focused on the electrographical onset of a seizure and the peri-ictal awareness of the patient, and only secondarily on the motor manifestations. However, there is currently no evidence that suggests a direct relationship between the psy- chological state of consciousness of a patient and physiological data recorded from wearables like accelerometry, electrodermal activity, or blood volume pulse. Conversely, introducing a ubiquitous and commonly applied (sub-)classification based primarily on movement and re- sponses of the autonomic nervous system may facilitate a more effective communication of wearable-based seizure detection methodologies and evaluations. The classification by Fisher et al.","What extensive data set of biosignal data from wearables was collected for the analysis studies presented in this thesis, and how were the participants recruited for this data collection?",en,"The extensive data set of biosignal data from wearables for the analysis studies presented in this thesis was collected from a cohort of 243 participants at two European epilepsy centers. These participants were recruited during their routine stay in an EMU (Epilepsy Monitoring Unit). More than 300 seizures of various types were recorded with a wrist-worn research-grade wearable device (Empatica E4), including expert-labelled seizure onset and offset as well as other relevant metadata.","The extensive data set of biosignal data from wearables was collected from 243 participants at two European epilepsy centers, who were recruited during their routine stay in an EMU."
"[27] already takes a step in this direction, but it is not yet universally implemented by current related work in this regard. 6.1.2 Selection of Meaningful Features Again resulting from the high diversity of epileptic seizures, the performance of epileptic seizure detection by wearables seems to be highly dependent on the recorded biosignal data modalities and the choice of features computed from them. In the work included here, visual inspection of signal traces during seizures (see Figure 4.1), experience from related work, and 6.1. PRACTICAL LESSONS LEARNED 129 some common sense were all very helpful in selecting the feature sets used in the analyses. Furthermore, some research was conducted to investigate the value of certain biosignals and features in a deliberate manner. Glasstetter et al. [348], for example, assessed the utility of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals from wearables to detect ictal tachycardia, comparing it to the gold standard of electrocardiography-based heart rate estimation. They conclude that PPG-based estimation is feasible for seizures where tachycardia onsets before motor mani- festations, but may be limited for other seizures due to motion artifacts impairing the signal. This was successively observed in the evaluation of focal motor seizure detection presented in this thesis as well (see Section 5.2). There is certainly room for improvement regarding the assessment of biosignal features, and more similar analyses are required beyond the current research. For example, studies applying metaheuristic feature selection and dimensionality re- duction algorithms to wearable biosignal data recorded from epilepsy patients could facilitate better performances of seizure detection. Moreover, non-feature-based approaches like deep learning could be a viable path forward, but these typically require vastly more quantities of data than would be recorded in in-hospital settings. 6.1.3 Wearable Device Design The current landscape of wearable devices for seizure detection is limited at best. By far the most prominent in related research is the Empatica E4 device, which was also used in the studies included in this thesis. Other devices exist and are in use [122], like the Byteflies Sensor Dots [353] or the Nightwatch bracelet [226], but they are often still in development, not certified as a medical device in the European Union, or limited to a few specific studies or contexts. Coincidentally, the Empatica E4 is also at the end of its lifetime and being phased out [354], to be replaced by a new wrist-worn wearable device from the same manufacturer (“Empatica EmbracePlus”), which however at the time of writing has not been featured in any peer-reviewed publications. During the data recording studies included in this thesis, the Empatica E4 exhibited sev- eral issues related to device design that interfered with recordings. Primarily, the device had several problems with the continuous streaming of data via Bluetooth connection. While the maximum range of the wireless connection was just enough to include the whole hospital room, such that the patient was able to move roam around the room, there were frequent and unprompted disconnects even if the wearable was well within range of the companion device. Better, more robust wireless hardware is likely needed to mitigate these disconnects. Alterna- tively, the device could implement a data buffer that temporarily captures biosignals internally whenever it loses the connection, transferring the data only if it is reestablished. Moreover, the battery life of the device was an issue, especially since the batteries tended to degrade over time, with each new participant. However, this is a general problem in wearable devices and not specific to this one, and new technologies and approaches are forthcoming. Lastly, the wristband of the device was not flexible enough, both in its material and possible wrist sizes. Materials that are more adaptive the individual’s anatomy, like fabrics or more pliant plastics, would facilitate better, cleaner biosignal recordings with sensors less prone to a loss of skin contact. Generally speaking, wearable devices in this domain need to balance a trade-off between being general-purpose consumer-grade devices, and being specialized research-grade devices. The former are often designed with comfort and usability in mind, a necessity for ultra-long- 130 CHAPTER 6. CONCLUSION term recordings that are essential in epilepsy diagnosis and research, but they rarely give ac- cess to raw biosignal data. The latter give access to raw data, are flexible in terms of firmware and sensor parameters, and typically facilitate better overall data quality, but are impractical at best in the at-home context due to battery limitations, connection issues, and design con- cessions. All that is to say, that wearable device design, from the ground up, should keep both the patients and the researchers in mind, and not be exclusive to one group or mindset. Fur- thermore, open data sets of biosignal data from wearables during epileptic seizures are still a rarity, but necessary for the continued improvement of seizure detection systems. Device manufacturers could look to build and share such data sets as a result of their device valida- tions, were they not focused solely on the design of proprietary, closed algorithms. In fact, entirely open-source ambulatory data collection and analysis with wearables was shown to be feasible, and could provide the foundation of future adaptive intervention systems [355]. 6.2 Outlook The data analysis studies included in this thesis each list some limitations that the respective evaluations were subject to. Naturally there was also some overlap between those studies’ limitations. Some prominent aspects that were listed included the generally low numbers of study participants and seizures included in the analyses, the “lab” conditions of the data collection, that is, in-hospital recordings, or data quality considerations. This section discusses some of these aspects in the context of potential further research work. 6.2.1 Ambulatory Data Collection All data recorded for the studies in this thesis were recorded from patients visiting an epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) at a hospital, where they are usually constrained to a room with elec- troencephalography (EEG) electrodes attached to their scalp. Thus, they are heavily restricted in terms of the movements they can or will do, impacting the nature of the biosignal data recorded. For example, patients will rarely do physical exercise while at the EMU, even though they would regularly do so in their daily lives.","What biosignals and features have been found valuable in the deliberate research for epileptic seizure detection using wearables, specifically regarding photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, and how do they compare to the gold standard of electrocardiography-based heart monitoring?",en,"In the deliberate research for epileptic seizure detection using wearables, specifically regarding photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, the utility of PPG signals has been found valuable. However, it was observed that PPG-based estimation may be limited during some seizures due to motion artifacts impairing the signal. This is particularly significant when comparing it to the gold standard of electrocardiography (ECG)-based heart monitoring. While PPG can detect ictal tachycardia in seizures where tachycardia onsets before motor manifestations, its performance may be compromised for other seizures. Therefore, there is room for improvement regarding the assessment of biosignal features, and more research is required beyond the current analysis to enhance the accuracy of epileptic seizure detection using wearables.","Valuable biosignals found for PPG-based epileptic seizure detection are tachycardia, with PPG-based estimation feasible for some seizures but limited by motion artifacts. It compares to the gold standard of electrocardiography-based heart monitoring, but may not be as effective in all cases."
"Accordingly, seizure detection methodologies must be validated in real-world data at some point. Ground truth information, however, is dif- ficult to record in ultra-long-term ambulatory studies. Current options include at-home video systems, which are often only viable during the night at the patient’s bed and thus are prob- lematic with respect to their privacy. Furthermore, there are wearable EEG systems like caps or single-channel behind-the-ear EEG, which are cumbersome, uncomfortable, stigmatizing, and inaccurate, and implantable EEG sensor systems which are invasive and have a high cost. Some few phase 4 ambulatory validation studies are ongoing [109, 223], but more studies with different devices, better ground truth, and larger patient cohorts need to be conducted. 6.2.2 Assessment of Data Quality Seizures are typically short, often as short as a few seconds, and so seizure monitoring re- quires a high temporal resolution of the biosignal data as compared to many other clinical applications [342]. Furthermore, data accuracy and reliability depend on the quality of the recorded signals [173]. However, clinical epilepsy studies with wearables frequently under- report quantitative measures of the quality of the recorded raw data. In particular, tools and 6.2. OUTLOOK 131 standard metrics determining the data and signal quality of wearable signals are currently missing. Yet, knowledge of artifacts and tools to assess their impact are crucial for subsequent analysis and outcome reliability, and there is a need for extensive, automatic, standardized data quality checks. Some recent studies have investigated wearable data quality in the con- text of epilepsy [159, 174], but more research is required. Comprehensive stand-alone studies are necessary to properly validate signal quality metrics, but this is easier said than done. Most of the biosignals recorded with the wrist-worn wearable used in this thesis, for example, do not have an immediately obvious direct gold standard that could be used as a ground truth. For electrodermal activity (EDA), dry electrodes are already the best existing methodology to record skin conductance changes, and there is no accepted best practice for other parameters like the position of the electrodes on the body or the type of electrode and mechanical contact. Additionally, the blood volume pulse data could be validated only indirectly by estimating a heart rate (HR) and comparing it to an electrocardiography-based HR. 6.2.3 Detection of Non-Motor Seizures In this thesis only seizures with some type of movement manifestation were considered. How- ever, many focal seizures do not include epileptic movements, but are limited to symptoms of the autonomic nervous system, impairment of awareness, or sensory auras. Automatic detec- tion of those events is likely to be more problematic. For one, the accelerometry biosignal will be meaningless and possibly even counterproductive, considering that random non-epileptic movements of the patient can still occur during those times. Furthermore, judging from the re- sults of the focal motor seizure detection, individualized analysis is likely to be the only worth- while pathway, at least with current wearable biosignal modalities. Nevertheless, the data set recorded for the studies presented here included some individual patients who had non-motor seizures with characteristic semiology like, for example, one with ictal goose bumps on the arms, which might be eligible for robust detection by EDA signals. Future studies or spe- cific case reports on these examples may benefit the general understanding of some epileptic seizure types and advance non-motor seizure detection with wearables. 6.2.4 Other Machine Learning Approaches In the seizure detection analysis contributed here, only supervised machine learning based on expert-labeled ground truth data was employed. This does not mean, however, that other approaches like unsupervised or reinforcement learning may not be equally, or even more so, relevant and effective. Many epileptic seizures are extreme events compared to the everyday life of patients, and so they can in a way be seen as outliers. Some research has already in- vestigated this approach based on EEG signals [356–358], but it remains an open issue and studies based on wearable data are yet to be published. Deep learning is another approach to machine learning that was not specifically included in this thesis. Artificial neural networks can adhere to any of the three main learning paradigms, supervised, reinforcement, or unsupervised. Supervised neural networks are typically trained with vast amounts of raw (non-feature) data, and thus would be most appropriate for ultra- long-term data sets from ambulatory settings. Data sets like this with non-EEG data from wearables are currently not available, but could be recorded with new devices suitable for daily at-home use, such as smartwatches. 132 CHAPTER 6. CONCLUSION Furthermore, methodologies that take feedback from patients into account, similar to how reinforcement or semi-supervised learning algorithms work, have thus far not been proposed or investigated thoroughly. Such a system would directly involve patients in the continuing improvement of a seizure detection model. For example, the model would be initially trained in a supervised manner on in-hospital data of a patient, and in the ambulatory setting a mobile application could notify the patient of a detected seizure. The patient would then give feedback if the detection was true or false, or if a seizure was missed and when it occurred. Based on those observations the model would then perpetually re-train itself on new data. Of course, the validation of such a system would still require ambulatory ground truth recordings, but current research shows that this is within reach. In conclusion, patient-involved detection methodologies that individualize over time have the potential to eventually become the best option for ultra-long-term seizure detection. Fu- ture improvements of biosignal sensors, batteries, and the design of wearable devices will sub- stantially advance the possibilities of a generic, ambulatory seizure detection system. Such a system could leverage ultra-long-term data and personal seizure logs as well as expert-labeled seizure episodes from in-hospital recordings to provide an automated seizure diary and alarm. And ultimately, this could even develop into a universal personal assistant that is tailored towards a specific patient’s wants and needs.

1. Ground Truth Information: Develop more accurate and reliable methods to validate ground truth information in ultra-long-term ambulatory studies. This could involve using a combination of video recordings, wearable devices, and electronic health records.

2. Privacy Concerns: Address privacy concerns associated with at-home video systems by ensuring data protection measures are in place and that patients consent to the recording and use of their data. Additionally, explore daytime monitoring solutions that do not require video recording during waking hours.

3. Comfort and Stigma: Improve the comfort, design, and stigma associated with wearable EEG systems by creating more user-friendly devices that are less intrusive and easier to use for extended periods.

4. Accuracy: Continue to develop and refine implantable EEG sensor systems to improve their accuracy, reduce cost, and minimize invasiveness. Additionally, focus on optimizing the algorithms used for seizure detection in all types of devices to increase their reliability and sensitivity.

5. Data Quality: Establish tools and standard metrics for assessing the quality of wearable signal data to ensure that studies using these devices report accurate quantitative measures. This will help identify artifacts and enable researchers to assess their impact on the results.

6. Ongoing Research: Conduct more phase 4 ambulatory validation studies using various devices, larger patient cohorts, and better ground truth information. This will provide a more comprehensive understanding of each device's performance in real-world scenarios.","To improve real-world validation of seizure detection methodologies, we need more studies using various devices, better ground truth, larger patient cohorts, tools to assess data quality, and methods addressing privacy concerns and comfort issues with current devices."

RF (Random Forest) représente peut-être une méthode de traitement ou de diagnostic basée sur les arbres aléatoires. RNS (Responsive Neurostimulation System) est probablement un système de stimulation nerveuse réagissant utilisé pour le traitement de l'épilepsie. SCL (Skin Conductance Level) est peut-être la conductivité électrique de la peau, qui peut être utilisée comme indicateur des changements de tension chez un patient atteint d'épilepsie. SCRR (Skin Conductance Response Rate) représente peut-être le taux de réponse à la conductivité électrique de la peau. SD (Standard Deviation) est une mesure statistique utilisée pour déterminer la dispersion des données autour d'une moyenne, et il peut être utilisé dans divers domaines comme la biomédecine. SDK (Software Development Kit) est un ensemble de composants logiciels qui peuvent être utilisés pour développer une application ou un système informatique spécifique. SPS (Simple Partial Seizure) représente peut-être une saisie partielle simples des convulsions, et SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy Patients) représente peut-être le décès subit et imprévu chez les patients atteints d'épilepsie.",RADAR-CNS: Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse - Central Nervous System.

1. Toshitaka Yamakawa et al. suggest developing a wearable epileptic seizure prediction system with machine-learning-based anomaly detection of heart rate variability (HRV). This implies that HRV data can be used to predict seizures in patients with epilepsy, thus enabling timely interventions.

2. Arthur Guez et al. propose adaptive treatment of epilepsy via batch-mode reinforcement learning. In this context, reinforcement learning algorithms are employed to learn optimal strategies for treating epileptic patients, taking into account various factors such as drug dosage and side effects.

3. Omer Gottesman et al. outline guidelines for reinforcement learning in healthcare. They emphasize the importance of clear definitions of rewards, proper specification of the state space, and addressing safety concerns to ensure that the learned policies do not lead to harmful outcomes.

4. Georg Heinze, Christine Wallisch, and Daniela Dunkler suggest considering variable selection when applying reinforcement learning in healthcare. Variable selection helps identify relevant factors influencing patient outcomes and reduces overfitting by excluding irrelevant variables from the model.

5. Nadia Burkart and Marco F. Huber provide a survey on the explainability of supervised machine learning, which is also important when using reinforcement learning in healthcare to ensure transparency and interpretability of the learned policies.

6. Osisanwo F.Y et al. do not directly discuss guidelines for reinforcement learning in healthcare but their work focuses on the application of supervised machine learning techniques in a health-related context, specifically in the prediction of disease outbreaks based on weather data.","The key guidelines for using Reinforcement Learning in healthcare, as discussed in the literature, include:
1. Anomaly detection of Heart Rate Variability for Epileptic Seizure Prediction (Yamakawa et al., 2020).
2. Adaptive treatment of epilepsy via batch-mode reinforcement learning (Guez et al., 2008).
3. Guidelines for reinforcement learning in healthcare (Gottesman et al., 2019).
4. Variable selection for the practicing statistician (Heinze et al., 2018).
5. Explainability of Supervised Machine Learning (Burkart & Huber, 2021)."

La première étude [165] explique les propriétés optiques des tissus humains, y compris de la peau, sous-cutanée et muqueuses, dans un intervalle de longueur d'onde allant de 400 à 2000 nm. Cette information est importante car elle fournit une base solide pour comprendre les interactions de la lumière avec le sang et la peau lors du procédé de photoplethysmographie, qui peut aider à améliorer la précision des mesures.

La deuxième étude [164] décrit les propriétés optiques de l'oxygène saturé du sang, ce qui est crucial pour comprendre comment le sang se comporte lorsque il est excité par différentes longueurs d'onde lumineuses. Cela permet à la recherche de déterminer quelles longueurs d'onde sont les plus appropriées pour mesurer les variations des volumes sanguins dans la peau, ce qui aide à améliorer la détection et l'évaluation de la fonction sanguine.

Enfin, les études [166] et [167] comparent la réflexion de la lumière rouge, verte et bleue dans le contexte de la photoplethysmographie, ce qui est important pour comprendre comment différentes longueurs d'onde peuvent influencer les mesures de changements de volume sanguin. Ces études aident à déterminer quelle longueur d'onde lumineuse est la plus efficace pour la mesure de la fréquence cardiaque, ce qui permet d'améliorer la précision et l'efficacité des dispositifs de photoplethysmographie.

En conclusion, ces études sont significatives car elles apportent des contributions importantes sur les propriétés optiques de la peau humaine, l'absorption et la réflexion scattering de l'oxygène saturé du sang, ainsi que la comparaison entre la photoplethysmographie utilisant différentes longueurs d'onde lumineuses.","The cited studies provide essential data on human skin optical properties (164, 165), oxygen saturation-dependent absorption and scattering of blood (165), and comparison between different wavelengths (red, green, blue) for photoplethysmography heart rate monitoring (166, 167)."

These advancements are crucial in improving our understanding of neurological disorders, refining diagnostic methods, and providing better care for affected individuals.","A wearable EEG is a portable device that records brain activity, often worn as a headset.

For example, a study by Baud et al. (2018) found that multi-day rhythms modulate seizure risk in epilepsy. Meanwhile, research by Stacey (2018) emphasizes the need to make seizure prediction practical for clinical use. Studies by Kuhlmann et al. (2018) and Karoly et al. (2021) explore the concept of cycles in epilepsy and their role in seizure forecasting and control. Additionally, Wannamaker (1985) discusses the relationship between the autonomic nervous system and epilepsy, while Burgess et al. (1997) study sleep and circadian influences on cardiac autonomic nervous system activity, which may be relevant to seizure forecasting and control as well. Overall, these studies suggest that our understanding of seizure cycles and the role of the autonomic nervous system in epilepsy is rapidly advancing, paving the way for more effective seizure prediction and management strategies.","Current advances in seizure forecasting involve multi-day rhythms modulating seizure risk, while cyclic control focuses on identifying cycles in epilepsy. Research is progressing towards practical applications and a new era of seizure prediction."

By combining data from different types of wearable devices (such as sensors, mobile phones, and wristbands), researchers can capture a more comprehensive view of physiological changes during a seizure event. This multimodal approach helps to validate the results obtained from individual devices, reduces the risk of false negatives or false positives, and allows for the exploration of potential correlations between different types of data (e.g., heart rate variability, movement patterns, skin conductance). In summary, using multiple wearable devices in seizure detection research is crucial for improving the reliability, validity, and utility of the data collected for advancing our understanding and management of epilepsy.","Multiple wearable devices are used for comprehensive seizure detection research, providing diverse data for improved accuracy and reliability.

In more recent studies, such as those by Jianjie Lu and Kai-Yu Tong (2019) and Martin Glasstetter, et al.

Therefore, the significance of recurrence plot strategies lies in their ability to provide insights into the complex, dynamic behavior of various systems by visualizing recurring patterns over time.

Email: jbtang@au1.ibm.com Funding information Epilepsy Research Fund Abstract Objective: Tracking seizures is crucial for epilepsy monitoring and treatment evalu- ation. Current epilepsy care relies on caretaker seizure diaries, but clinical seizure monitoring may miss seizures. Wearable devices may be better tolerated and more suitable for long-­term ambulatory monitoring. This study evaluates the seizure de- tection performance of custom-­developed machine learning (ML) algorithms across a broad spectrum of epileptic seizures utilizing wrist-­ and ankle-­worn multisignal biosensors. Methods: We enrolled patients admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit and asked them to wear a wearable sensor on either their wrists or ankles. The sensor recorded body temperature, electrodermal activity, accelerometry (ACC), and photoplethys- mography, which provides blood volume pulse (BVP). We used electroencephalo- graphic seizure onset and offset as determined by a board-­certified epileptologist as a standard comparison. We trained and validated ML for two different algorithms: Algorithm 1, ML methods for developing seizure type-­specific detection models for nine individual seizure types; and Algorithm 2, ML methods for building general seizure type-­agnostic detection, lumping together all seizure types. Results: We included 94 patients (57.4% female, median age = 9.9 years) and 548 epileptic seizures (11 066 h of sensor data) for a total of 930 seizures and nine seizure types. Algorithm 1 detected eight of nine seizure types better than chance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC-­ROC] = .648–­.976). Algorithm 2 detected all nine seizure types better than chance (AUC-­ROC = .642–­.995); a fusion of ACC and BVP modalities achieved the best AUC-­ROC (.752) when combining all seizure types together. Significance: Automatic seizure detection using ML from multimodal wearable sen- sor data is feasible across a broad spectrum of epileptic seizures. Preliminary results 1808 | TANG et al. 1 | INTRODUCTION Epilepsy is a common cause of morbidity and mortality, es- pecially among children, despite advances in management regimens.1,2 Accurate monitoring and tracking of seizures are important to evaluate seizure burden, recurrence risk, and response to treatment. Outside the hospital, seizure track- ing relies on patients' and families' self-­reporting, which is often unreliable due to underreporting, seizures missed by caregivers, and patients' difficulties recalling seizures.3–­6 Although long-­term video-­electroencephalography (EEG) in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) is the gold standard for accurately diagnosing and evaluating epilepsy,7 it is also time-­consuming and costly, can be perceived as stigmatizing, and places a greater burden on patients and caregivers than seizure monitoring with wearable devices. Based on prior studies, there exists a large clinical gap and urgent medi- cal need to detect a broad range of seizures, beyond focal to bilateral tonic–­clonic seizures (FBTCSs) and generalized tonic–­clonic seizures (GTCSs), with wearable devices.3,8–­10 Recent advances in the use and development of non-­EEG-­ based seizure detection devices utilizing a variety of sensors and modalities provided innovative opportunities to fill this gap and to monitor patients continuously in the outpatient setting. Examples include wrist-­worn or arm-­worn devices, devices worn on the chest, and mattresses,11–­19 which, among others, are less stigmatizing and better tolerated by patients during extended use.11,20–­23 Furthermore, analyzing signal recordings using artificial intelligence learning algorithms led to improved performance of seizure detection systems. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are trained to au- tomatically detect signal patterns of epileptic seizures. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using ML, and in particular deep learning models, to automati- cally detect seizures and classify seizure types based on EEG data.24,25 Although similar ML approaches applied to monitoring data from mobile devices can detect generalized tonic and tonic–­clonic seizures,26 detection of other seizure types using data from wearable devices is limited. There exists a critical need for reliable, automatic, nonintrusive methods to detect additional clinical seizure types. Based on the analysis of a large clinical seizure dataset of wrist-­ and ankle-­worn wearable device data confirmed by time-­ synchronized EEG, we aimed to evaluate seizure detection with wearable devices for a broad spectrum of epileptic sei- zures. We hypothesized that detection of a variety of seizure types solely based on wrist-­ and ankle-­worn sensor data is feasible, utilizing EEG seizure onset and offset annotations as a gold standard comparison. 2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS We obtained approval from the institutional review board of Boston Children's Hospital before enrollment and data ac- quisition. We prospectively enrolled patients admitted to the Boston Children's Hospital EMU between February 2015 and November 2017. We asked participants to wear sensors (E4; Empatica) on either the left or right wrist or ankle for long-­ term recording during their admission. The wearable devices recorded body temperature (TEMP), electrodermal activity (EDA), accelerometry (ACC), and photoplethysmography to provide blood volume pulse (BVP; Figure S1a). We obtained written informed consent or assent from all participants or their guardians. show better than chance seizure detection.","What is the title and main focus of the research article ""Seizure detection using wearable sensors and machine learning: Setting a benchmark"" published in Epilepsia journal?",en,"The title of the research article is ""Seizure detection using wearable sensors and machine learning: Setting a benchmark"", and its main focus is on developing a method for detecting seizures using wearable sensors and machine learning, with the aim of setting a benchmark in this field.","Title: ""Seizure detection using wearable sensors and machine learning: Setting a benchmark""

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License | 1809 TANG et al. 2.1 | Patient and seizure selection criteria We extracted clinical data from the electronic medical re- cords with a standardized data collection tool in Microsoft Excel and REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture; Vanderbilt University), a secure web-­based application that facilitates data acquisition and storage. We collected demo- graphic data, clinical patient data, and seizure characteristics. Epileptic seizure semiology and etiology were classified ac- cording to the International League Against Epilepsy crite- ria,27 and patients with a high hourly frequency of seizures or clusters of four or more seizures in 15-­min time windows were excluded. 2.2 | Seizure data collection This study utilized the conventional 10–­20 electrode scalp EEG system during video-­EEG monitoring.28 Video-­EEG review by a board-­certified clinical epileptologist confirmed electrographic seizure onset and offset annotations as well as semiology of seizure types. 2.3 | Synchronization of EEG and wearable device clocks The wearable device and EEG monitor record with independ- ent clocks. To compensate for the time drift between the de- vice and EEG clocks, we synchronized the device clocks at the start of the device recording. After we turned on the re- cording device, we simultaneously pressed the device button and EEG event marker button. This created a time tag on both the device and EEG recordings. When we placed two weara- ble devices on the patient, the button press was done simulta- neously for both. We recorded a video of the syncing process and used video timestamps to verify device placement times in cases where we could not find EEG event markers due to button press failures. When patients agreed to wear the recording device again on a second day or in another admis- sion, they were enrolled again, and the process was repeated. We defined the start timing error between the wristband and EEG clock as the time difference between the wristband and EEG clock at the beginning of the experiment (Figure S1b). Figure 1A shows the distribution of start timing errors observed in our study; absolute errors follow approximately a Gaussian distribution and are predominantly shorter than 20 s. The wearable devices also have button press failures, which are indicated by a large start timing error. We set the start timing error to 0 when there is a button press failure. To ensure the seizure segment is within the annotation, we added 20-­s preseizure and 20-­s postseizure end windows. Figure 1B shows the timing drift of the Empatica E4 for 11 different devices at different time points, confirming device-­ agnostic frequency stability of 1 ppm12 and a constant timing drift of 13 s in 24 h. These observations allowed us to derive the following three-­step timing error compensation scheme: (1) 13-­s offline timing drift compensation was added to the signal data; (2) the start timing error was calculated (Figure S1b), and labels were adjusted accordingly; and (3) 20-­s pre- seizure and 20-­s postseizure end windows were added. In a final step, we added verified seizure annotations to the signal data. 2.4 | Data quality check We downloaded EEGs and wearable sensor device data sepa- rately and manually labeled each dataset. Subsequently, we reviewed data for possible missing or incorrect annotations, recording failures, or missing data by running seizure an- notations and wearable sensor device data through custom-­ developed quality check processes (Figure S2). Patients occasionally removed wristbands. In this study, we used TEMP sensor data to detect whether the wristband had been removed. We used a 10-­min moving average to smoothen the TEMP recordings. For temperature values higher than 45° or lower than 27°, we added 10-­min safety windows to both ends of the segment, and we excluded this time window from the study. 2.5 | Data analysis 2.5.1 | ML techniques We used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify raw time series data and applied random undersampling to balance the raw data. We first trained different detection models separately on individual ACC, EDA, and BVP data. Then we serially trialed different combinations of sensor mo- dalities, including ACC and EDA, ACC and BVP, EDA and BVP, and ACC, BVP, and EDA. The entire ML framework and the architectures and functionalities of the developed CNN models are shown in Figure 2. Our CNN model consists of two convolutional layers. Convolutional Layer 1 is followed by Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and dropout operations. Convolutional Layer 2 is fol- lowed by ReLU and max pooling. The final layer is a global average pooling29 layer. The network outputs are probabilis- tic distributions related to the target classes. In Poh et al.,30 data reduction and support vector machines (SVMs) were used to detect secondarily generalized tonic–­ clonic seizures with 94% sensitivity and a .74/24-­h false alarm rate (FAR). We applied this method to tonic–­clonic 15281167, 2021, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/epi.16967 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [06/03/2025].","How effective is the use of deep learning algorithms, combined with multisensor recordings from wearable devices like wrist-worn and ankle-worn devices, for the automatic detection of various types of epileptic seizures, considering the results obtained across a spectrum of nine seizure types and data fusion techniques such as ACC and BVP?",en,"The use of deep learning algorithms combined with multisensor recordings from wearable devices like wrist-worn and ankle-worn devices has been found to be quite effective for the automatic detection of various types of epileptic seizures. This is based on the results obtained across a spectrum of nine seizure types, and data fusion techniques such as ACC (Accelerometer) and BVP (Blood Volume Pulse). The combination outperformed single data modality, with an overall Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) of .752 when applied to the complete dataset. Interestingly, machine learning models trained using all seizures regardless of their type performed better overall than models trained on specific seizure types. This suggests that automatic epileptic seizure detection using machine learning and wearable device data is feasible across a broad spectrum of motor and nonmotor seizures.","The deep learning algorithms, combined with multisensor recordings from wearable devices, showed promising effectiveness in automatically detecting various epileptic seizures across nine types, with data fusion techniques like ACC and BVP performing well."

To ensure the availability of sufficient data to train the seizure type-­specific ML models (Scenario 1), we chose to apply leave-­one-­subject-­out cross-­validation to those seizure types for which datasets contained more than five patients and in total 10 seizures. This allowed us to test the perfor- mance of the developed ML models for nine seizure types (Table 1). For validating the general seizure detection method (Scenario 2), we applied 10-­fold cross-­validation to evaluate the performance of the developed ML models for all patients and seizure types. For each fold, the patients in the validation dataset are excluded from the training dataset. The majority of patients in our cohort wore two func- tioning sensor devices on opposite sides of the body on their wrists and/or ankles. For some patients, one device stopped working during the study due to battery life limitations. Additionally, some patients chose to wear only one device. We treated each wearable sensor device recording of a sei- zure as an individual sample during training, which allowed us to maximize the amount of training data. During testing, we used only one wristband recording for those seizures with two simultaneous wristband recordings. We strictly excluded all seizure samples contained in the training dataset from the respective test dataset at all times, and therefore model per- formance was never tested on any data that had been used for training such models. FIGURE 1 Wristband and electroencephalographic (EEG) monitor clocks show different drift rates over time. For seizure detection with seconds-­level accuracy, the timing error must be measured and compensated to enable consistent data labeling and analysis consistent with video-­ EEG recordings.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License | 1811 TANG et al. 2.6 | Statistical methods Previous studies26,31 utilized custom-­defined seizurewise performance metrics to account for specific experimen- tal scenarios, data formats, and clinical use cases. We also custom-­defined and applied seizurewise performance met- rics. We added 1-­min preictal and postictal buffers before and after each ictal segment. We consider a seizure detected if it is correctly labeled within the preictal, ictal, and postictal windows. We divide the interictal period into nonoverlapping 1-­min intervals. If multiple false alarms occurred within a single 1-­min interval, they are reported as one single false alarm. The sensitivity measures apply to the proportion of cor- rectly identified seizures. FAR is the number of incorrectly detected seizures over 24 h. We defined detection delay as the difference between the seizure onset and detector recognition of seizure activity. We calculated seizurewise area under the curve (AUC)–­ receiver operating characteristic (ROC) value, sensitivity, and FAR per 24 h. The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (also known as sensitivity) against the FAR at various threshold settings. AUC is the area under the ROC curve. The higher the AUC, the better the model is at distin- guishing seizures from nonseizure events. For leave-­one-­subject-­out cross-­validation, we calculated sensitivity, FAR, detection delay, and AUC-­ROC by combin- ing all subjects' prediction results. For leave-­one-­subject-­out cross-­validation, we calculated sensitivity, FAR, detection delay, and AUC-­ROC by combining all folds' prediction results. 3 | RESULTS We included 94 patients who met our inclusion criteria (me- dian age = 9.9 years, range = 27.2, interquartile range = 9.2; 54 [57.4%] males; Table 1, Figure S3), and 548 seizures. For training purposes, we had seizure onset and offset annotations for 930 seizures captured by both left and right sensor devices. The dataset is highly imbalanced, containing 153 h of ictal and 10 913 h of normal interictal brain activity signals.

In Algorithm 1, we trained seizure-­type specific detection models for nine seizure types based on the following inclu- sion criteria: FBTCSs, GTCSs, focal tonic seizures, focal subclinical seizures, focal automatisms, focal behavior arrest, focal clonic seizures, generalized tonic seizures, and general- ized epileptic spasms (Table 2). We found better than chance detection for eight of nine seizure types. In Algorithm 2, we lumped all seizures from different seizure types together to build a general type-­agnostic sei- zure detection system. For this scenario, we also display individual seizure type-­specific detection performance and compare it to Algorithm 1 (Table 3). We found bet- ter than chance detection potential for all nine seizure types, including seizures with and without robust motor components. 3.1 | Algorithm 1: Specific ML model for individual seizure types We trained a specific model for each seizure type with leave-­ one-­subject-­out cross-­validation (Table 2). ACC performed best for focal tonic seizures and BVP for focal behavior arrest and generalized tonic seizures. ACC + BVP data fusion pro- vided the best averaged AUC-­ROC performance. The model detected GTCSs and FBTCSs with an AUC-­ROC of .976 and .932, respectively. The algorithm detected focal tonic sei- zures, focal automatisms, focal behavior arrest, generalized tonic seizures, and focal clonic seizures with an AUC-­ROC of more than .6, suggesting better than chance detection. AUC-­ROC for focal subclinical seizures was less than .6, in- dicating a poor, close to chance detection performance of our algorithm for this seizure type. 3.2 | Algorithm 2: Generalized ML model for all seizure types We trained a model with all 94 patients and 548 seizures with 10-­fold cross-­validation, shown in Table 3. Except for EDA, the overall AUC-­ROC performance was greater than .6 for all modalities, yielding better than chance detection perfor- mance. ACC and BVP modalities reached AUC-­ROC values of .72 and .744, respectively, and ACC + BVP data fusion reached the highest overall AUC-­ROC of .752. 3.3 | Comparison of Algorithms 1 and 2 We calculated the AUC-­ROC performance comparison be- tween Algorithm 1 (type-­specific ML model for individual seizure types) and Algorithm 2 (type-­agnostic generalized ML model) for all seizure types (Figure 3). For all three sensors, the averaged results show that the generalized ML model for all seizure types performs better than the specific ML model for individual seizure types. 3.4 | Impact on EDA shift We visualized seizure annotations and sensor data. EDA shows a delayed response time. Figure S4a shows two ex- amples of EDA increasing after a seizure. We compared the performance of the EDA sensor without shifting and with shifting 120 s ahead. Figure S4b shows AUC-­ROC for dif- ferent seizure types, and EDA shifting shows an AUC-­ROC improvement for FBTCSs (.716 vs. .516) and GTCSs (.830 vs. .519) without a major impact on other seizure types.

We applied EDA shifting for 120 s to all fusions of sensor modalities. 4 | DISCUSSION 4.1 | Summary In our study, we used a seizure-­level evaluation for seizure detection and found that fusing ACC and BVP data modali- ties achieved the best AUC-­ROC of .752 applied to all sei- zure samples lumped together across all seizure types when we trained one generalized model with all seizure types. Results show the feasibility of seizure detection across a broad spectrum of seizure types, including but not limited to GTCSs, with wrist-­worn wearable sensors in a large cohort of patients. Our study expands current literature by demon- strating that noninvasive, wrist-­ and ankle-­worn sensors and custom-­developed deep learning techniques can automati- cally detect a variety of epileptic seizure types. Numerous previous studies have shown the feasibility of using ML and, in particular, deep learning models to auto- matically detect,24 classify,25 and predict5,32 epileptic seizure episodes in EEG signals. Initial studies using electrodes im- planted in the brain have increasingly been followed with less intrusive systems measuring scalp EEG data.33 The advent of commercially available medical-­grade wearable sensors and mobile smart devices, such as smartwatches, provided an opportunity to assess the suitability of other data modal- ities for seizure detection.8 Some of these explorations have shown promise for detecting GTCSs,23,26,31,34 and based thereon smartwatches have first received US Food and Drug Administration approval and medical clearance for use as ep- ilepsy monitoring devices.35,36 4.2 | Performance comparison for GTCSs We compared a previously utilized detection method30 with a CNN to detect GTCSs. In the previous study, the authors ex- tracted 19 features from ACC and EDA, then applied SVM, and reached an AUC-­ROC of .896, a sensitivity of 73%, and a FAR of 12.52/24 h. Our CNN reached an AUC-­ROC of .957, a sensitivity of 80%, and a FAR of 13.63/24 h. The CNN performed better than Poh et al. 's method, as shown by the 5.9% higher AUC-­ROC value. However, the perfor- mance of the CNN is lower than the SVM reported in the mentioned study30 (94% sensitivity and .74/24h FAR). One main reason could be that our dataset contains mainly chil- dren, a cohort that tends to exhibit pronounced movement activity during seizure-­free times. Additionally, the study reported a median electrographic latency of 42.95 s. In our study, the average latency is 51.67 s. Onorati et al.26 included 55 convulsive epileptic seizures (six focal tonic–­clonic sei- zures and 49 FBTCSs) from 22 patients and achieved 83.6% sensitivity and .29/24h FAR. Their study26 included 24 chil- dren and 45 adults, with an age range of 4–­18 and 19–­60 years, respectively, including patients who did not experi- ence seizures during the experiment. In comparison, our patients are children, with only three patients older than 20 years. Once monitoring data from children and adolescents are included in a dataset, seizure detection may become more challenging. The algorithm in Onorati et al.26 failed to detect all three seizures of a 4-­year-­old child. 4.3 | Effect of detection modality We expected that models trained on specific seizure types would perform better than models trained on the combined TABLE 3 10-­fold cross-­validation performance Seizure type ACC EDA BVP ACC + BVP ACC + EDA BVP + EDA ACC + EDA + BVP Focal to bilateral tonic–­clonic .919 .662 .886 .910 .905 .862 .890 Focal tonic .812 .624 .736 .772 .789 .719 .758 Focal subclinical .555 .429 .642 .623 .520 .603 .568 Focal automatisms .541 .699 .811 .761 .772 .807 .780 Focal behavior arrest .765 .532 .693 .713 .730 .593 .737 Focal clonic .564 .588 .830 .762 .593 .758 .668 Generalized epileptic spasms .840 .450 .711 .831 .796 .632 .789 Generalized tonic .662 .565 .779 .746 .698 .661 .704 Generalized tonic–­clonic .995 .802 .889 .992 .987 .939 .990 All nine seizure types .720 .549 .744 .752 .695 .672 .705 Note: 10-­fold cross-­validation performance of detection models trained on individual modality data (Columns 1–­3) and multimodality data fusion (Columns 4–­7).

The main reasons for this are that (1) we have lower patient and seizure numbers per seizure type for each type compared to the lumped dataset; these lower sample numbers may not be enough to train a high-­performance ML model; and (2) different sensor modalities may perform similarly across dif- ferent seizure types. We found better than chance detection potential for all nine studied seizure types, including focal and general- ized seizures. ACC and BVP performed better than chance, with an AUC-­ROC of .72 and .744, respectively; ACC and BVP data fusion achieved the best AUC-­ROC of .752 when applied to the entire dataset consisting of all seizure sam- ples lumped together from all nine seizure types. All nine clinical seizure types performed better than chance, with an AUC-­ROC ranging from .648 to .995.","What is the best AUC-ROC value achieved in the study by fusing accelerometry (ACC) and blood volume pulse (BVP) data modalities for seizure detection, when using a generalized model with all seizure types?",en,"The best AUC-ROC value achieved in the study by fusing accelerometry (ACC) and blood volume pulse (BVP) data modalities for seizure detection, when using a generalized model with all seizure types, is .752.",The best AUC-ROC value achieved was .752 by fusing accelerometry and blood volume pulse data modalities.
"ACC sensors achieve the best performance for most seizure types, similar to other studies that employ commercial smartwatches37 using the standard ACC sensors and running the developed analyti- cal models, showing utility in detecting seizures with motor components, especially GTCSs.14,15 BVP performed best for some seizure types, namely focal motor seizures with au- tomatisms and subclinical seizures. Given the sensitivity of BVP to motion, which may result in artifactual signals,34,38 FIGURE 3 Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-­ROC) performance comparisons between a generalized type-­agnostic machine learning (ML) model for all seizure types and a type-­specific ML model for individual seizure types. An AUC-­ROC less than .6 is not significant compared to random guess. For AUC-­ROC levels greater than .6, accelerometry (ACC) performed similarly for focal to bilateral tonic–­clonic seizures (FBTCSs), focal tonic seizures, generalized tonic seizures, and generalized tonic–­clonic seizures (GTCSs); blood volume pulse (BVP) performed similarly for FBTCSs, focal tonic seizures, focal behavior arrest, generalized tonic seizures, and GTCSs; electrodermal activity (EDA) performed similarly for FBTCSs, focal automatisms, and GTCSs. For all three sensors, the average performance of the generalized ML model for all seizure types is better than the performance of the specific ML model for individual seizure types 15281167, 2021, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/epi.16967 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [06/03/2025].

BVP may there- fore assist in the detection of the peri-­ictal period of tonic–­ clonic seizures and focal unaware seizures.39,40 EDA with or without ACC has shown promise in the evaluation of con- vulsive seizures,26,30,41 and may also be able to detect focal seizures.41 In our study, EDA's overall AUC-­ROC of .549 is not significantly better than chance, but EDA AUC-­ROC values reached .802, .699, and .662 for GTCSs, focal autom- atisms, and FBTCSs. Although adding EDA to data fusions yielded an overall decreasing performance of all combina- tions (ACC + EDA, BVP + EDA, ACC + BVP + EDA), the detection performance for some seizure types increased when EDA was included. For example, in focal automatisms, the performance of ACC + EDA is better than ACC only (.772 vs. .541). Shifting EDA by 120 s showed significant improve- ment, especially for GTCSs and FBTCSs. Because the delay of EDA can vary for different seizures, applying an adaptive detection model may further improve its performance. Whereas we used the same types of analytical models and data processing methods for all data modalities and fusion datasets in this study, future work will focus on developing advanced deep learning architectures and data preprocessing schemes individually for each data modality and integrating additional clinical features. We expect that this will allow us to leverage clinical and data modality-­related features, thus further improving detection performance and cross-­patient generalizability of detection models. 4.4 | Individualized seizure detection Seizures are associated with altered autonomic nervous system activity, manifesting as system changes, including changes in heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, and sweat- ing responses.42 Monitoring of such physiologic signals may allow for tracking of seizure-­related autonomic changes and seizure detection, and ultimately also provide information re- garding sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) risk and seizure severity.41 In particular, multimodal signal analy- sis has shown promise in this area.43–­47 Findings may also complement the detection of nonconvulsive seizures, which are harder to monitor and detect with non-­EEG devices.8 Tracking seizures and evaluating the seizure burden re- mains challenging, as these tasks rely heavily on patient or caregiver reporting that may be incomplete.3,6 Proper track- ing of seizures, on an individual level, is crucial for disease management, improving outcomes, injury prevention, and potentially decreasing the risk of SUDEP. A user-­friendly, portable, noninvasive, nonstigmatizing tool that reliably de- tects seizures can improve patients' quality of life and their health outcomes and may improve the evaluation of treatment outcomes based on seizure frequency.11,45,47–­49 Closed-­loop seizure detection systems are aimed at seizure detection and prediction to provide early warnings to control or prevent sei- zures.8,11 Modalities with slower time to detection, such as EDA in our study, may be more suitable for seizure diary pur- poses or clinical trials looking at seizure frequency and recur- rence assessment with greater sensitivity and specificity. Our results suggest that wrist-­worn and commercially available sensors, running advanced deep learning models and data preprocessing techniques, could be a feasible out-­of-­the-­box starting alternative to custom-­developed monitoring devices. Our results also suggest that individualized customization of detection modalities based on clinical features, including sei- zure semiology, may improve detection performance in se- lected patients. 4.5 | Challenges We need to interpret our results in the setting of data acquisi- tion. Specifically, we included pediatric patients admitted for in-­hospital long-­term EEG monitoring; activities and behav- iors may differ from those at home and manifest differently in wearable device signals. Although the patients were ad- mitted to the hospital, they were free to move around and per- form certain activities such as playing video games, drawing, pedaling, and watching TV as feasible in this setting. Longer recordings over several days may help account for daily pat- terns and variations of seizure characteristics. We collected signals from one or two devices, depending on availability, placed on the left or right wrist or ankle. This may interfere with the consistency of the signals, as different parts and sides of the body may generate signals that differ in quality and characteristics. We included various seizure types in our analysis, yet there are additional seizure types that we have not investigated. During the data collection phase, EEG labels were manu- ally inputted into the annotation system, and wearable signal data were manually downloaded and saved. Performed man- ually, these processes are prone to human error. Furthermore, signal segments may be compromised by switched-­off wear- able devices and battery failures. To account for these short- comings, we ran a stepwise quality check process (Figure S2). EEG monitors and wearable devices run on independent clocks.","What is the overall performance comparison between ACC sensors and BVP in detecting various types of seizures, considering their respective strengths and weaknesses in terms of artifacts and sensitivity? (Consider the information given in the text about Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-­ROC) and the different seizure types such as GTCSs, focal motor seizures with automatisms, subclinical seizures, FBTCSs, focal tonic seizures, generalized tonic seizures, etc.)",en,"L'analyse du texte indique que les capteurs d'accélération (ACC) ont un meilleur rendement global pour la plupart des types de crises épileptiques, similaire aux études précédentes utilisant des smartwatches commerciales équipées des capteurs ACC standards et exécutant les modèles analytiques développés, ce qui démontre une utilité pour la détection de crises avec des composants moteurs, notamment les GTCS. En revanche, le capteur du volume sanguin pulsatile (BVP) a performé mieux pour certains types de crise épileptiques, tels que les crises focales motrices avec automatismes et les crises sous-cliniques. Cependant, en raison de la sensibilité du BVP aux mouvements, qui peut entraîner des signaux artifactuels, le BVP a un risque plus élevé de produire des signaux artificiels. En termes d'AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve), ACC et BVP ont toutes deux des performances similaires pour les crises FBTCS, focales toniques, généralisées toniques, GTCS et autres. Cependant, il est important de noter que la performance moyenne globale du modèle ML générique pour toutes les crises épileptiques est meilleure que celle du modèle spécifique pour chaque type de crise.","ACC sensors and BVP show similar overall performance in detecting various seizure types, with ACC being more reliable for GTCSs and other seizures while BVP is better for focal motor seizures with automatisms and subclinical seizures. However, BVP's susceptibility to motion artifacts should be noted."
"Hence, we synchronized EEG and wearable device times at the start of each recording and accounted for possible time drift between the clocks. 4.6 | Conclusions Automatic epileptic seizure detection of a broad variety of seizure types using ML and wearable data is feasible. 15281167, 2021, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/epi.16967 by Cochrane France, Wiley Online Library on [06/03/2025].

Preliminary results show better than chance seizure detec- tion across a range of nine seizure types. Future improve- ments may consider clinical chronoepileptological variables, such as seizure duration and etiology or syndrome, as well as alternative data balancing, pre-­ and postprocessing, fusion, and ensemble learning methods. Thus, although our findings suggest feasibility, future adjustments may further improve detection performance. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study was funded in part by the Epilepsy Research Fund.

The poor reliability of self-reported seizure diaries for many people with epilepsy is well-established, but these records remain necessary in clinical care and therapeutic studies. A number of wearable devices have emerged, which may be capable of detecting seizures, recording seizure data, and alerting caregivers. Developments in non-invasive wearable sensors to measure accelerometry, photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA), electromyography (EMG), and other signals outside of the traditional clinical environment may be able to identify seizure-related changes. Non-invasive scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and minimally invasive subscalp EEG may allow direct measurement of seizure activity. However, signiﬁcant network and computational infrastructure is needed for continuous, secure transmission of data. The large volume of data acquired by these devices necessitates computer-assisted review and detection to reduce the burden on human reviewers. Furthermore, user acceptability of such devices must be a paramount consideration to ensure adherence with long-term device use. Such devices can identify tonic–clonic seizures, but identiﬁcation of other seizure semiologies with non-EEG wearables is an ongoing challenge. Identiﬁcation of electrographic seizures with subscalp EEG systems has recently been demonstrated over long (>6 month) durations, and this shows promise for accurate, objective seizure records. While the ability to detect and forecast seizures from ambulatory intracranial EEG is established, invasive devices may not be acceptable for many individuals with epilepsy. Recent studies show promising results for probabilistic forecasts of seizure risk from long-term wearable devices and electronic diaries of self-reported seizures. There may also be predictive value in individuals’ symptoms, mood, and cognitive performance. However, seizure forecasting requires perpetual use of a device for monitoring, increasing the importance of the system’s acceptability to users. Furthermore, long-term studies with concurrent EEG conﬁrmation are lacking currently. This review describes the current Brinkmann et al. Seizure Monitoring Outside the Clinic evidence and challenges in the use of minimally and non-invasive devices for long-term epilepsy monitoring, the essential components in remote monitoring systems, and explores the feasibility to detect and forecast impending seizures via long-term use of these systems. Keywords: wearable devices, seizure detection, seizure forecasting, multidian cycles, machine learning, epilepsy INTRODUCTION It has long been recognized that seizures occur more frequently than self-reported, though the scale of this underestimation has only recently been appreciated (1–4). This has complicated our ability to provide optimal care and safety strategies (5, 6), and casts uncertainty on the validity of therapeutic strategies and clinical trials results (4). Wearable sensing devices are increasing in popularity both in the general community and through medical applications such as seizure detection. However, there is insuﬃcient data relating to the clinical utility and reliability of these systems (7). There are also signiﬁcant concerns around data security, privacy, and data ownership (8), and questions relating to the optimal software, hardware, and data transmission systems. Additionally, there are several separate issues to consider with wearable devices: how the data is acquired, what systems can be used to achieve this acquisition, and how the data may be used to provide more sophisticated feedback to individuals and their caregivers. Wearable devices may also facilitate reliable forecasts of seizure likelihood, providing the potential for people with epilepsy to take fast-acting medications or modify activities in anticipation of an impending seizure (9–11). Chronically implanted intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) systems have resulted in dramatic insights into the dynamics and underlying rhythms of epileptic activity and seizures (2, 12–19) but are not suitable for widespread use because of issues relating to cost and risk, and are limited in spatial sampling. In addition to unreported seizures, these devices also detect a large number of electrographic seizure patterns without clear behavioral correlates. However, this electrographic epileptic activity is highly relevant to epilepsy management and seizure forecasting, and chronic EEG remains vital to develop and validate standalone wearable systems. These recent studies suggest that the aims of seizure forecasting might be achieved through capturing data, which represent trends and associations in individuals and populations, harnessing the strength of multiple sources, and applying recently developed strategies in machine-learning to combine this information and generate measures of seizure risk. Seizure forecasting using these techniques might ultimately become a useful way for individuals to manage daily activities, and for clinicians to accurately judge the eﬃcacy of therapies.","What is the title, authors, publication details, and specialty section of the article titled ""Seizure Diaries and Forecasting With Wearables: Epilepsy Monitoring Outside the Clinic"" published in Frontiers in Neurology?",en,"Title: Seizure Diaries and Forecasting With Wearables: Epilepsy Monitoring Outside the Clinic

"SEIZURE REPORTING AND DETECTION An obstacle currently to clinical management of epilepsy is the scarcity of accurate, reliable information available to the physician when diagnosing a seizure disorder and identifying therapeutic options. Because seizure events are infrequent, the physician may not be able to directly observe events, and must rely on the individual, caregivers, and other witnesses to describe events, identify potential precipitants, report their frequency, and discuss the impact on the person’s daily life (20). In-hospital diagnostic tests are expensive and may produce a diagnosis of epilepsy, psychogenic non-epileptic events, or syncope, or may be diagnostically inconclusive. Even when a clear diagnosis of epilepsy is established, the limited availability of accurate information hinders eﬀective therapy (1). People with epilepsy may be partly or fully amnestic to seizures (21, 22), individuals may be unable to provide an accurate account of seizure occurrence and severity (23–25), and witness accounts of epileptic and behavioral events are often unreliable (26–28). Changes in seizure frequency and severity, sometimes due to poor medication adherence (29), may increase a person’s risk of SUDEP (30), status epilepticus (31), or injury during daily activities. Currently, physicians and caregivers have no way to identify increases in seizure frequency and/or severity between oﬃce visits. Many studies conﬁrm that people under-report their seizures for a variety of reasons [summarized by Elger and Hoppe (3)]. A study of an implanted EEG monitoring device for seizure forecasting (2), compared to monthly self-reported seizure diaries to ambulatory intracranial EEG, found vast discrepancies in seizure reports, with some subjects reporting no seizures in months where the device recorded hundreds of clinical and electrographic seizures. Compared to long- term ambulatory EEG monitoring, individuals were found to report less than half of measured seizures (3), and people with epilepsy enrolled in clinical medication trials were aware of their own seizure underreporting in post-study telephone interviews (4). Objective data characterizing seizure counts (32) and severity (33) could be obtained using devices capable of capturing and storing EEG or other biosignals that indicate seizure occurrence. Invasive, implanted EEG (33) devices with limited capabilities are available currently. The NeuroPace RNS device (16, 34) is clinically available and provides responsive neurostimulation to suppress seizures in focal epilepsy, but also has the ability to record and store limited data segments on the device. Investigational devices like the Medtronic PC+S have a similar capabilities (35, 36) but are used only in limited research applications. The limited data capacity of such devices makes it diﬃcult to evaluate detection sensitivity because there is no way to conﬁrm that all seizures have been identiﬁed, although identiﬁed and stored events can be conﬁrmed as electrographic seizures (speciﬁcity). Finally, minimally invasive subscalp EEG Frontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org 2 July 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 690404 Brinkmann et al. Seizure Monitoring Outside the Clinic devices are emerging as potential alternatives for continuous EEG recording, providing a balance between signal quality and user acceptability. One subscalp system (24/7 EEGTM SubQ) has been CE-marked for epilepsy monitoring and diagnosis, following a cumulative 490 day trial (nine patients, up to 90 days each) demonstrating its safety and feasibility (37). Automatically assisted, visual identiﬁcation of electrographic seizures has also been demonstrated in the ultra long-term setting (>6 months) with this system, with excellent sensitivity but low speciﬁcity (38). Non-invasive Seizure Monitoring Non-invasive, wearable biosensors have the greatest immediate potential to meet the needs of the majority of people with epilepsy. The availability of inexpensive miniaturized electronic components, wireless data telemetry, and rechargeable battery technology has given rise to a large number of lightweight, wearable sensors. Currently, sensors are commercially available to measure continuous, non-invasive photoplethysmography (PPG, to measure the blood volume pulse signal), electromyography (EMG), accelerometry, EEG, electrocardiography (EKG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and skin temperature in a range of form factors. A summary of available sensors is given in Figure 1 (see also Panels in Appendix). Most individuals are familiar with the accelerometers and optical PPG sensors included in consumer electronics like smart watches and ﬁtness monitors. These inexpensive sensors with sophisticated data processing algorithms on cloud-based data management systems are capable of tracking sleep and exercise rates based on accelerometry (39–41), although the accuracy of sleep staging with these devices is unclear. Variable accuracy has been found as well in tracking heart rates from wrist-worn PPG sensors (42). Nevertheless, wearable biosensors remain of interest for epilepsy management, as changes in sleep quality (43), exercise (i.e., heart rate and motion tracking) (44), and stress (i.e., heart rate variability, EDA) (45, 46) may all trigger seizure onset for some people. Currently, there are two wearable sensors approved by the FDA and EU for detecting convulsive seizures: the ﬁrst, a wrist-worn smartwatch (Empatica Embrace, Boston MA), uses accelerometry and EDA to detect the subject’s movements and maintains a Bluetooth link to the subject’s smartphone, where an application telemeters data and detections to cloud servers and issues caregiver alerts for seizures (47). The Empatica Embrace was CE Marked in 2016 and FDA approved in 2018. The second device is attached by an adhesive patch aﬃxed to the subject’s bicep and identiﬁes changes in EMG to detect convulsions (BrainSentinel SPEAC, San Antonio TX). This device also has a cloud-based data platform and can send caregiver alerts and was CE Marked in 2013 and FDA approved in 2017 (48). Other CE-Marked devices are available (Biovotion Everion, ByteFlies Sensor Dots, Livassured NightWatch, Epi-Care Free), and studies of performance at detecting seizures are ongoing. Detection of convulsive or motor seizures is relatively easier than other seizure types (49), and studies are beginning to address these other more diﬃcult semiologies, but only with modest success to date (50– 52). As detection performance improves, approved devices may become an adjunct measure of seizure activity for anti-seizure medication trials. These would likely initially be used exclusively for the detection of tonic–clonic seizures, as wearable sensors are most performant for this seizure type. Most commercially available sensors do not have regulatory approval for use in epilepsy, and these sensors span an array of form factors and capabilities.","What challenges does a physician encounter in accurately diagnosing and managing epilepsy due to the infrequency of seizures, limited availability of information, and potential amnesia experienced by patients?",en,"A physician faces several challenges in accurately diagnosing and managing epilepsy due to the infrequency of seizures, limited availability of information, and potential amnesia experienced by patients. These challenges include:

1. Direct observation of events is not possible: Since seizure events are infrequent, a physician may not be able to directly observe episodes, making it difficult to obtain accurate details about the nature, frequency, and severity of the seizures.

2. Relying on patient reports and witness accounts: Physicians often have to rely on patients, caregivers, and other witnesses for descriptions of events, identification of potential triggers, reporting of seizure frequency, and discussions about their impact on daily life. However, people with epilepsy may be partly or fully amnestic to seizures, making it difficult for them to provide an accurate account of seizure occurrence and severity. Additionally, witness accounts of epileptic and behavioral events are often unreliable.

3. Diagnostic tests: In-hospital diagnostic tests can be expensive and may produce a diagnosis that is inconclusive or mistaken for conditions other than epilepsy, such as psychogenic non-epileptic events or syncope.

4. Limited availability of information hinders effective therapy: The scarcity of accurate, reliable information available to the physician makes it difficult to establish an effective treatment plan. Even when a clear diagnosis of epilepsy is established, the lack of detailed and consistent data can hinder appropriate management.

5. Under-reporting of seizures by patients: Many studies confirm that people under-report their seizures for various reasons, making it challenging for physicians to assess changes in seizure frequency and severity between office visits. This under-reporting may increase a person's risk of complications such as SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy), status epilepticus, or injury during daily activities.

6. Changes in medication adherence: Changes in seizure frequency and severity, sometimes due to poor medication adherence, can also pose challenges in managing the condition effectively.","A physician encounters challenges in accurately diagnosing and managing epilepsy due to infrequent seizures, limited information availability, unreliable witness accounts, patient amnesia, and under-reporting of seizures."
"The majority of commercial smartwatches now carry accelerometric and PPG sensors, which could be useful in tracking seizures (53), and smartwatch and smartphone applications have been developed for this purpose. Rigorous testing data is needed, however, and until clear estimates of sensitivity and speciﬁcity under a range of conditions are established, wearable systems should not be considered reliable sources of clinically actionable information (54). Apple and FitBit’s consumer grade wearables have FDA and CE approval for cardiovascular monitoring currently, and as data accumulates, regulatory approvals for epilepsy could be possible. Devices aimed at the clinical research market are available in a wrist-watch form factor (Empatica E4, Geneactiv), and this form factor is often rated well by people with epilepsy for comfort and ease of use (55). Smart devices in a ring form factor (e.g., Oura and Motiv) can collect accelerometry and ﬁnger PPG. The small size of these devices severely limits their battery capacity, and most devices do not incorporate real-time Bluetooth data linkage. Ring devices may be useful for seizure diary applications, or to provide estimates of sleep quality and other factors to forecasting algorithms, but currently are not able to provide physiological data in real time. PPG data quality is adversely aﬀected by subject movement, and wrist and hand-worn PPG sensors may suﬀer due to limb movements. Recently published results of commercially available wearable sensors in seizure detection are summarized in Table 1. Arm-band style wearable biosensors are available (Biofourmis, BrainSentinel), and many adhesive wearable sensors can be placed on the arm (Byteﬂies). This is a prime location for measuring EMG, and muscle activity can be used as a proxy for convulsive seizure activity. This placement may also facilitate simultaneous EKG measurement if wires are run through the sleeve to the subject’s chest, although this may create maintenance challenges for long-term use. Arm band sensors can be rated lower in comfort and acceptability by subjects (62), and data quality may suﬀer due to movement or the sensor sliding slightly during wear. Small sensors aﬃxed by adhesive patches (ByteFlies, EpiLog) can conceivably be placed anywhere on the body, although hair and perspiration may interfere with adhesives. Adhesive failure and skin irritation are a barrier to long-term (multiple weeks) and ultra long-term (months to years) use of these devices, although these devices may be suitable for prolonged (up to 7 days) monitoring (e.g., baseline seizure diaries). This category may be the most ﬂexible sensor type, and there are commercially available research- quality sensors for EEG, EMG, EKG, PPG, accelerometry, and EDA (ByteFlies, Epilog).

In addition to mature, commercially available wearable biosensors, numerous early-stage sensors are under development, which may ﬁnd application in epilepsy. Sweat sampling sensors are being developed for exercise applications and can non-invasively measure glucose, lactate, sodium, and other metabolites as well as drug or medication levels excreted in sweat. Fluidic sensors with similar technology have been integrated into mouth guards (65) and fabrics (66) to sample saliva and other bodily ﬂuids. Google subsidiary Verily Inc. developed a contact lens with integrated glucose sensors, but abandoned the project in 2018 citing inconsistent monitoring results (67). Known hormonal and metabolic factors that may be altered prior to or immediately following seizures include melatonin (68), cortisol (69), reproductive hormones (70), prolactin and growth hormone (71), lactate, glucose (72), tRNA fragments (73), and others (74), thus providing a range of possible biomarkers for seizure detection. The ﬁeld is evolving rapidly, and many innovative new sensors will likely become available. Hopefully, new sensor technologies will allow for the detection of a broader range of seizure types, beyond convulsive events. Behavioral Monitoring Beyond sensing of basic biosignals, wearable devices and smartphones can be used to track behavior at more complex levels, including activity patterns, movement range, sleep duration and quality, and behavioral indicators of mood, for example, based on analyses of movement speed, social connectivity, or aﬀective tone of speech (75–77). This opens up a window to analyzing behavioral changes occurring over days or weeks, which may correlate with seizure risk as suggested by studies on prodromes and on seizure precipitating factors (78, 79). Beyond passive monitoring, smartphones can be used to track mood changes and cognitive function by actively querying the user (80). Assessments can include pop-up questionnaires at predeﬁned times, as well as speciﬁc test batteries assessing general cognitive capabilities like attention or working memory, thus capturing high level dynamic brain states. The use of a smartphones also allows for behavioral intervention, which is becoming a prominent adjunct therapy (81). DESIGNING AND CONNECTING SEIZURE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS: DECREASING BARRIERS TO USE Despite a general willingness of people with epilepsy, caregivers, and healthcare professionals to use seizure monitoring devices (55), there are signiﬁcant user requirements that impede long- term use. Johansson et al. concluded that on average 19% (range 6–24%) of data recorded from wearables in free-living environments may be missing due to a combination of technical and human factors (82). Cohen et al. found in a long-term study of wearables in Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease that app-based reminders (“push notiﬁcations”) are useful tools in increasing continued device adherence (83), which could provide similar outcomes in seizure monitoring. The aesthetics and comfort of devices are signiﬁcant considerations in improving long-term adherence with wearable devices. Bruno et al.","What are the current regulatory statuses of smartwatches and smart rings in terms of approval for cardiovascular monitoring, and what potential approvals could be possible in the future for epilepsy-related uses?",en,"Currently, Apple and FitBit's smartwatches have FDA and CE approval for cardiovascular monitoring. As data continues to accumulate, regulatory approvals for epilepsy could be possible for these consumer-grade wearables in the future. Smart rings, on the other hand, do not currently have such approvals, but they can collect accelerometry and finger PPG data that might be useful for seizure diary applications or providing estimates of sleep quality and other factors to forecasting algorithms.","Currently, Apple and Fitbit's smartwatches have FDA and CE approval for cardiovascular monitoring. Potentially, they could receive regulatory approvals for epilepsy in the future."
"found that smartphone and watch-based devices were acceptable to over 70% of people with epilepsy; however, leg, upper-arm, chest, and head-based systems had <50% acceptance. Ring-style wearables had over 60% approval (84). Interestingly, there is a strong discrepancy between the views of people with epilepsy and caregivers for wristband and ring-style wearables, although why this is so is unclear (55). Performance characteristics are signiﬁcant as well, and Patel et al. (85) showed a strong preference among people with epilepsy and caregivers for excellent sensitivity and text message alerts over comfort, battery life, and other features. Unfortunately, Patel et al. do not separate their responses between people with epilepsy and their caregivers, making it unclear if there are diﬀerences in view between these two groups. Furthermore, it is not clear that device users’ reported preferences are truly predictive of their behavior. Janse et al. showed signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the preferences of people with epilepsy and caregivers in device form factors, device accuracy, and seizure forecast range (10). Charging the batteries of wearable devices presents a considerable adherence challenge, as devices are ideally worn continuously through both sleep and wakefulness (55). It is estimated that 38– 60% of users claim to be satisﬁed with recharging a device at least daily (55, 85). Battery charging depends on frequency of data sampling and telemetry.

This approach is attractive for immediate feedback to people with epilepsy and caregivers but would pose a considerable burden on the battery of both the wearable device and smartphone for clinical quality sensor data on the order of 100s of samples per second. Computation and Connectivity Connecting data sources through cloud technologies has the potential to create insights into seizure patterns (86) and even forecast seizure events (9, 87). Measurements of a person’s environment, physiology, and behavior through smartphones and wearables can be used to make patient-speciﬁc models that help clinicians understand individuals’ risk factors (88). The following sections outline common methods for accessing data sources (such as seizure diaries or wearables) through cloud technologies. Figure 2 presents an overview of how various software interfaces may interact with device data. Modern on-demand computing services make the collection and distribution of large datasets of potentially unknown size, expanding in response to the users’ needs (14, 89). Importantly, data sources should use common formats and deﬁnitions for data storage, particularly for imperative entries such as timestamps, seizure type descriptions, and deﬁnitions of seizure durations (90). Without accurate timing information, errors can occur between data sources, creating noisy repositories, and inaccurate forecasts. Removing diﬀerences between data sources minimizes barriers to integrating heterogeneous data streams and gives the best opportunity for improved care. Machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence methods are integral to seizure detection and forecasting with wearable biosensors. Machine learning approaches allow algorithms to adaptively learn patterns in data, which may not be apparent to the human observer. Traditional machine learning requires preprocessing raw data to extract features or characteristics of interest, which are then normalized and passed to a classiﬁcation algorithm for analysis. However, deep learning, or convolutional neural network approaches, provides “end to end” learning, where extraction of salient features is handled by the initial layers of the neural network after repeated presentation of training data (91). Automatic feature extraction is considered a key advantage of deep learning for seizure prediction, because it enables an algorithm to be tailored to particular seizure types or even an individual seizure semiology (or semiologies) (92, 93). Despite this ability for automated feature extraction, the signals recorded must contain some fundamental information relating to seizure events, and hence, appropriate device and sensor selection is still required for utility. For a discussion on factors that may contribute to seizure likelihood, see Section Factors contributing to seizure likelihood. A hurdle for machine learning, and deep learning in particular, is that algorithms typically require a very large number of training seizures in order to learn a generalized representation of the data. Epilepsy databases have facilitated development of machine learning and deep learning methods for seizure detection (94) and forecasting (95–99). This “big-data” approach may improve accuracy in detecting more challenging seizure types.","Why do people with epilepsy and their caregivers have a strong preference for excellent sensitivity and text message alerts over comfort, battery life, and other features in smart devices designed for epileptic seizure detection? Is there a notable discrepancy in these preferences between the two groups (people with epilepsy and their caregivers)? Additionally, are device users' reported preferences truly predictive of their behavior in real-life situations?",en,"People with epilepsy and their caregivers have a strong preference for excellent sensitivity and text message alerts over comfort, battery life, and other features in smart devices designed for epileptic seizure detection because they prioritize accurate detection and prompt notification during seizures. This is crucial for the safety and wellbeing of individuals with epilepsy. As for your second question, yes, there seems to be a notable discrepancy in these preferences between people with epilepsy and their caregivers, as shown in studies like Janse et al., which highlight differences in device form factors, device accuracy, and seizure forecast range between the two groups. However, it is important to note that the text does not explicitly state that there are differences in the preference for sensitivity and text message alerts between people with epilepsy and their caregivers. Lastly, while preferences are significant, it is unclear if device users' reported preferences are truly predictive of their behavior in real-life situations as it is estimated that adherence to using these devices continuously may present a challenge for many users.","They prioritize excellent sensitivity and text alerts for immediate response due to the nature of epileptic seizures. Preferences might differ between users and caregivers, as suggested but not clearly confirmed in studies. Real-life behavior may not fully align with reported preferences."
"FORECASTING SEIZURE LIKELIHOOD People with epilepsy consistently rate the apparent unpredictability of their seizures to be the most disabling aspect of their condition (10, 11), and a reliable system to forewarn individuals or caregivers of impending seizures could allow fast-acting medications to be administered, or simply allow Frontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org 5 July 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 690404 Brinkmann et al.

Seizure Monitoring Outside the Clinic FIGURE 4 | Overview of wearable devices in epilepsy. a person to take preparatory measures. To date, most devices for use in epilepsy monitoring have been focused on seizure detection, where the main utility from the perspective of people with epilepsy is providing a seizure alert to their clinicians or caregivers. In this context, false alarms have the potential to be disruptive to the life of someone with epilepsy, their families, and caregivers, and can cause people to stop using seizure detection devices (100). However, in seizure forecasting applications, the primary end goal is to inform the individual of their current seizure likelihood. This context reduces the impact of “false alarms,” as not every high likelihood alert would be expected to result in a seizure (92). When evaluating forecasts, probabilistic measures can be used instead of only counting “hits” and “misses.” Therefore, although the problem of seizure forecasting is more complex than seizure detection from a signal analysis perspective (101), wearable devices may have broader application and wider acceptance in seizure forecasting, which will allow people with epilepsy to plan daily activities and take measures for seizure control. One retrospective validation study of seizure forecasting with wearables recently reported better than chance results in 30 of 69 (43.5%) in-hospital patients studied (102), conﬁrming that forecasting with non-invasive devices is possible for many patients. The ability to record continuous, outpatient data from wearables will enable long-term tracking of risk factors and should improve forecasting performance. Instead of trying to predict the exact time of an upcoming seizure, it may be more feasible to estimate the probability of someone having a seizure and communicate this risk in a clinically useful manner (12, 92, 103, 104). Accordingly, there is increasing interest within the clinical epilepsy community to develop seizure forecasting devices and applications (9) and understand user requirements (10, 105). In a survey-based study, Schulze-Bonhage et al. reported that probabilistic forecasts were generally considered equally useful to predicting exactly when a Frontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org 7 July 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 690404 Brinkmann et al. Seizure Monitoring Outside the Clinic seizure would occur (105). They also found that missed seizures were considered worse than false alarms, and perfect accuracy was not considered a requirement for a forecasting device (105). This survey agrees with reports from individuals enrolled in the human study of a long-term seizure forecasting device (the NeuroVista trial) (2). Subjects in the NeuroVista trial reported on the usefulness of the device (106, 107), despite less than perfect sensitivity and time-in-warning of up to 30% (2). More recently, Janse et al. also showed that seizure forecasting devices were deemed broadly acceptable despite the potential for inaccuracy (up to “inaccurate 30% of the time”) (10). Externally worn devices were ranked more highly than subcutaneous or implantable devices (10), reinforcing the potential for development of wearable devices for seizure forecasting applications. The development of qualitative and clinically useful metrics to evaluate seizure forecasts has been a key priority. Probabilistic measures can be used to evaluate performance (86, 108, 109), but deﬁning an alarm threshold is often deemed necessary to determine clinical utility and the system becomes parameterized by the alarm duration, or “seizure prediction horizon” (110). Nevertheless, evaluation of false alarms is challenging because there is signiﬁcant individual variability between seizure prediction horizons (2), and the “time-in-warning” is frequently reported as a proxy for a false alarm rate (2, 95, 111). In addition to benchmarking performance, it is important to understand user requirements for a forecasting interface (112). A recent study surveyed people with epilepsy and caregivers about the visual design of seizure forecasts, ﬁnding a range of preferences, although graphs that provided some temporal context (i.e., seizure risk plotted over the course of a day or month as opposed to a “gauge”) were rated more highly (113). Ultimately, post- hoc studies and surveys can only provide an indicative measure of the utility and beneﬁts of a seizure forecasting device. In a prospective setting, some people initially with interest in forecasting devices may ﬁnd false alarms to be debilitating, whereas others who were initially skeptical about the beneﬁts may ﬁnd a forecasting device very helpful (107). Patterns and Rhythms in Seizure Probability It is now understood that most people with epilepsy exhibit circadian and slower, multiday temporal cycles that modulate their seizure likelihood [see (17) for a recent review]. Recent studies have demonstrated impressive seizure forecasting performance using multiday cycles measured from implantable EEG (114, 115), although prospective validation is needed. Cycles of seizure likelihood can also be measured from self- reported seizure times (116), and for a subset of people, cycles measured from seizure diaries are predictive of the likelihood of electrographic seizures and epileptic activity (116, 117).",What potential benefits could arise from the integration of wearable devices and smartwatch data into online databases for seizure monitoring in individuals with epilepsy?,en,"The potential benefits that could arise from integrating wearable devices and smartwatch data into online databases for seizure monitoring in individuals with epilepsy include:

1. Improved understanding of seizure patterns and triggers: By collecting and analyzing large amounts of physiological, behavioral, and environmental data over time, researchers and clinicians can gain a deeper understanding of patient-specific risk factors for seizures. This information can be used to develop more effective seizure management strategies.
2. Real-time forecasting of seizure likelihood: Utilizing cloud computing technology, this collected data can be integrated into an individualized model of seizure likelihood and displayed as a real-time forecast to the user. This could allow fast-acting medications to be administered before a seizure occurs or simply allow caregivers to prepare for the event.
3. Improved accessibility and collaboration: By storing data in cloud-based repositories, it becomes accessible to relevant clinicians and researchers through a web interface or programmatic access. This can facilitate collaboration and communication between healthcare providers, leading to more informed and coordinated care.
4. Personalized care: The individualized nature of this approach allows for the creation of personalized seizure management plans tailored to each patient's unique needs and circumstances. This can help improve outcomes and quality of life for people with epilepsy.","Benefits could include personalized seizure forecasting, enabling timely medication administration and improved management of the condition."
"Machine learning can also be used with historic trends from self-reported seizure diaries, which may be useful to forecast future reported seizures (118, 119). Both cyclic and machine- learning approaches have been shown to accurately forecast seizures (or, more speciﬁcally, seizure diary events) in both focal and generalized epilepsies. Despite inaccuracy in individual seizure reporting, long-term patterns and cycles may still be accurately inferred for many individuals (116, 117). Due to the indications for use of who can have implanted EEG for long-term recording, the existence of cycles has largely been validated electrographically in individuals with focal epilepsies. Continuously recorded biomarkers remain important to truly characterize underlying epileptic rhythms, without the inherent limitations and biases of self-reported seizure diary records (120). Wearable devices and subscalp EEG have the potential to improve seizure diaries by providing objective data and complementary information to help eliminate noise. Objective seizure measures may capture more seizures, enabling cyclic patterns to be detected earlier and characterized more accurately (38). On the other hand, seizure detection with wearable devices currently has a high error rate, and has only been established for convulsive or motor seizures (48–50, 121), although progress is ongoing for other seizure types (51, 52, 93, 122, 123). The distribution of errors with wearables is likely to be diﬀerent to the error distribution of self-reported seizure diaries. There may also be gaps or poor quality data due to non-adherence or charging issues (124). Wearable seizure detectors may perform better at night, when there are fewer movement artifacts, and when individuals are less likely to self-report seizures (3). Wearable devices also do not suﬀer from diary fatigue, or other uniquely human biases. Therefore, wearable devices may have the potential to improve the accuracy and completeness of the historic record of individuals’ seizure times when used along with a seizure diary. A more accurate seizure count, or a combined forecast from the two data streams (86), may provide a higher performing forecaster for users. A better record of seizure times enables personalized forecasting models to be trained and validated more rapidly and with greater reliability. Factors Contributing to Seizure Likelihood Combining multiple sources of information, including cyclic patterns, EEG features, and other environmental factors, may contribute to a stronger forecast of seizure likelihood than any individual signal. There are many data sources that are readily available and have been shown to be associated with seizure likelihood. For example, sleep quality (68), weather (125, 126), mood (78), and stress (45, 46) may all make seizures more likely. These environmental factors can be combined with information from seizure times that capture individuals’ daily, weekly, or monthly cycles to deliver an individualized forecast of seizure likelihood (12, 92, 104). Wearable devices provide an opportunity to augment seizure forecasts with a growing number of physiological signals relevant to seizure likelihood. For instance, changes in heart rate have been often found to precede seizure onset by several minutes (127). Billeci et al. found that heart rate variability could be used to predict seizures up to 15 min before onset with >80% sensitivity, albeit with a relatively high average false positive rate of 0.41 per hour (almost 10 per day) (128). Signals that show some well-deﬁned ictal changes, such as EDA (129–131), heart rate, or EMG (121), also show predictive changes prior to seizure onset (32). For instance, a recent study found predictive value in wearable sensor recordings EDA, blood volume pulse, Frontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org 8 July 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 690404 Brinkmann et al. Seizure Monitoring Outside the Clinic accelerometry, and skin temperature (102). Average heart rate has also been found to show similar circadian and multiday cycles to epileptic activity, which are comodulated with seizure risk (132). Long-term datasets that record large numbers of individual seizures over long periods of time in conjunction with continuous wearable monitoring data promise to shed new light on these patterns governing autonomic nervous system and metabolic activity that are co-modulated with seizure onset. The potential of wearable monitoring to track individual seizure triggers may be more powerful when coupled with behavioral and mood data. Figure 3 illustrates the concept of a multi-modal seizure forecasting system. There is some early promise that physiological signals derived from peripheral or autonomic systems (i.e., cardiac activity) contain relevant information for predicting seizure onset. Figure 4 illustrates a number of these systems. Currently, insuﬃcient evidence exists that any stand-alone peripheral signal could be used as a seizure forecast with adequate sensitivity and speciﬁcity (105). However, with more data to determine patient- speciﬁc trends, and in combination with other predictive signals, wearable monitoring may contribute to an integrated forecast of seizure likelihood. As more prospective, clinical studies of forecasting systems are undertaken, a better understanding of the ideal signals, device speciﬁcations, user needs, and performance benchmarks will be elucidated, and forecasting systems may begin to reduce the burden of seizure unpredictability on people living with epilepsy. CONCLUSION We are at the edge of a transition in the way that we identify, analyze, and manage seizures and epilepsy. At the moment, however, there is still relatively limited data on which to base decisions about the suitability of various devices currently available, and the types of seizures in which they might be best deployed, particularly for non-motor events. There are challenges ahead regarding the hardware, power, data, and security of the various devices available, though these problems are being solved in numerous mobile device applications. Signiﬁcant challenges remain around issues related to usability of the systems, and certainly their chronic use. Developing concepts though relating to utilization of multiple modality streams and integrating this information will serve to provide accurate data on which to more eﬀectively manage epilepsy in the clinic and evaluate new therapies. Ultimately, data from a variety of systems will contribute to seizure forecasts and enable people with epilepsy to achieve a greater degree of safety, freedom, and dignity.

Considering the accuracy and longevity of various types of continuous sensors used in different studies, it appears that advancements have been made in improving both aspects. For instance, fourth-generation subcutaneous continuous glucose sensors have demonstrated high accuracy, as shown in a study by Christiansen et al., while an implantable continuous glucose sensor was tested for 180 days and showed good accuracy and longevity according to Kropff et al. Additionally, wearable salivary uric acid mouthguards with integrated wireless electronics have been developed, demonstrating potential in the field of biosensors (Kim et al.). However, it's important to note that more research may be needed to ensure the comfort and acceptability of such devices for soldiers during their active service. The progress made in these areas could potentially enhance the utility of these monitoring devices for military personnel, contributing to improved health outcomes. Regarding the diabetes-detecting contact lens project by Alphabet's Verily, it has been halted as of 2018, which might imply that more research is needed to achieve the desired level of comfort and acceptability before such a device can be practical for everyday use.","The wearing comfort and acceptability of ambulatory physical activity monitoring devices in soldiers can significantly influence their usage, as demonstrated by the high accuracy and longevity reported for various types of continuous sensors like glucose and salivary uric acid biosensors."

Several studies have been published in reputable journals demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques in seizure prediction.

For instance, researchers Kiral-Kornek et al. (2018) and Nejedly et al. (2019) have developed systems using big data and deep learning for seizure prediction, respectively, in humans and canines with epilepsy. Similarly, Eberlein et al. (2018) and Korshunova et al. (2017) utilized CNNs for the same purpose in their studies.

Moreover, Mormann et al. (2007) provide an overview of the history and challenges in seizure prediction, while Meisel et al. (2020) have recently published a study using machine learning from wristband sensor data to forecast seizures non-invasively.

Stacey WC (2020) emphasizes that while seizure prediction is indeed possible, the challenge now lies in making these predictions practical and ready for widespread use. Overall, research is progressing in utilizing advanced machine learning techniques like deep learning and CNNs to predict epileptic seizures more accurately and non-invasively.","The current state of research focuses on using deep learning and convolutional neural networks to predict epileptic seizures. Several studies have shown promising results in both humans and canines, with ongoing work aiming for improved design and practical application."

Seizure Monitoring Outside the Clinic APPENDIX: PANELS Panel 1: What Is Wearable? This review focuses on how wearable devices can be used to aid chronic, lifetime epilepsy management. Devices that may be comfortable for a few hours, or even a day may not be classed as wearable for life. Furthermore, the term “wearable” implies a degree of accessibility that assumes no specialized medical knowledge is required for use. Smartwatches Highly popular lifestyle tech device. Signals: photoplethysmography, O2 saturation, skin temperature, skin conductance, accelerometry, location (GPS), EKG (in development). Smart Rings Similar to smartwatches but with diﬀerent movement artifacts. Signals: photoplethysmography, O2 saturation, skin temperature. Arm Bands Sensors mounted on a band around the upper arm. Some devices may be placed with adhesive stickers. Signals: Heart rate, muscle activity, oxygen saturation, skin temperature, skin conductance, accelerometry. Stick-On Sensor Patches Subtle patches stuck anywhere on the body that are either re-useable or easily replaced at regular intervals, such as EEG electrodes placed behind the ear, or blood-glucose arm patches. Signals: EEG/EKG/EMG, accelerometry, glucose, cortisol (in development). Smart Phones Smart phones are not strictly wearable but most wearable devices integrate and present information to users via smartphone. Furthermore, more and more people now carry their smart phone at all times, in a pocket or handbag. Signals: Location, accelerometry, microphone, usage patterns, many aspects of external environment. Excluded Devices This review does not consider most scalp EEG electrode caps or headbands to be wearable. Similarly, implantable devices may be eminently suitable for long-term use, but they are not considered “wearable.” PANEL 2: KEY CONSIDERATIONS IN WEARABLE DEVICE DESIGN • Comfort: devices should be able to be worn without discomfort for extended periods of time, including during sleep and activities such as exercise and bathing. • Battery life: wearables should be able to record at least 24 h of activity without needing to recharge the device. Recharging time should be limited to a few hours. Connectors should be standard types such as micro-USB or USB-C. • Accessibility: design of devices and associated phone apps should account for diﬀerences in age groups, genders, vision capabilities, and body sizes. Particular care should be given to testing PPG sensors on a variety of skin pigments. • Appearance: devices should be inconspicuous, or otherwise not immediately identiﬁable as medical devices. • Security: data security and individual anonymity are of high concern to users, caregivers, and clinicians. Diﬀerent regions and jurisdictions will have unique requirements for security compliance, and laws regarding data access and ownership. • Internet connectivity: Broadband or 4G internet is required to transmit data eﬃciently. Devices can only store a limited amount of data internally before requiring upload to an associated device (e.g., via Bluetooth) or the cloud. • Integration: interfacing with other devices is essential. Connection with resources such as diaries, smartphone sensors, and location is becoming ubiquitous. PANEL 3: CASE STUDY: A BUMP IN THE DARK A 30-year-old man presented with a generalized tonic–clonic seizure after over 12 months of seizure freedom on 500 mg Sodium Valproate once daily. He complained of 6 month history of occasionally feeling poorly rested. An MRI appeared normal, and he was otherwise generally healthy. After two 7-day video- EEG studies (ﬁrst non-diagnostic), a GTCS was captured lasting 2 min occurring during sleep, of which he had no memory. An additional 500 mg Sodium Valproate was given in the evening and began wearing a wrist-worn accelerometry device to detect nocturnal seizures in the home. Three events were detected within a 2-month period, none of which could be recalled. Carbamazepine was commenced, and he has since been free of seizures for over 6 months. This case presents a common problem—a seizure diary that provides little information to guide treatment, and non- diagnostic, time-consuming video-EEG studies. Monitoring within the home can provide longitudinal seizure counts with reasonable sensitivity for GTCS events (from both wakefulness and sleep) and provide near real-time alerts to caregivers. Without a wearable device, multiple video-EEG studies may be required to measure the eﬀect of each of the additional medications. Frontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org 14 July 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 690404","What is the relationship between autonomic changes during seizures, postictal EEG suppression, electrodermal activity, and heart rate modulation in predicting and monitoring convulsive seizures using a wearable biosensor?",en,"The text discusses several studies on seizure detection and monitoring, primarily focusing on autonomic changes during seizures, postictal EEG suppression, electrodermal activity (EDA), and heart rate modulation.

Autonomic changes during seizures (130) are found to correlate with postictal EEG suppression, suggesting a connection between these physiological responses and seizure activities. (130)

The study in (131) focused on 24-hour patterns of EDA recordings for patients with epileptic seizures and control groups. This research may help identify specific EDA patterns associated with seizures.

The article in (132) discusses how multiday cycles of heart rate modulate seizure likelihood at various timescales, including daily, weekly, and monthly. This finding suggests that monitoring heart rate patterns could potentially aid in predicting and monitoring convulsive seizures.

Finally, the text mentions a wearable biosensor for seizure detection, which presumably would incorporate EDA and accelerometry data (from wrist movements) to monitor autonomic changes and other physiological responses related to seizures. The use of such a device could potentially allow for more accurate and convenient seizure monitoring outside the clinical setting.","Autonomic changes during seizures correlate with postictal EEG suppression. Electrodermal activity patterns, along with heart rate modulation, may help predict and monitor convulsive seizures using a wearable biosensor."

Artiﬁcial intelligence encompasses a variety of areas, and one of its branches is deep learning (DL). Before the rise of DL, conventional machine learning algorithms involving feature extraction were performed. This limited their performance to the ability of those handcrafting the features. However, in DL, the extraction of features and classiﬁcation are entirely automated. The advent of these techniques in many areas of medicine, such as in the diagnosis of epileptic seizures, has made signiﬁcant advances. In this study, a comprehensive overview of works focused on automated epileptic seizure detection using DL techniques and neuroimaging modalities is presented. Various methods proposed to diagnose epileptic seizures automatically using EEG and MRI modalities are described. In addition, rehabilitation systems developed for epileptic seizures using DL have been analyzed, and a summary is provided. The rehabilitation tools include cloud computing techniques and hardware required for implementation of DL algorithms. The important challenges in accurate detection of automated epileptic seizures using DL with EEG and MRI modalities are discussed. The advantages and limitations in employing DL-based techniques for epileptic seizures diagnosis are presented. Finally, the most promising DL models proposed and possible future works on automated epileptic seizure detection are delineated.

Introduction Epilepsy is a noncommunicable disease and one of the most common neurological disorders of humans, usually associated with sudden attacks [1]. Sudden attacks of seizures are a swift and early abnormality in the electrical activity of the brain that disrupts the part or whole body [2]. Various kinds of epileptic seizures are affecting around 60 million people worldwide [3]. These attacks occasionally provoke cognitive disorders that can cause severe physical injury to the patient. Moreover, people with epileptic seizures sometimes suffer emotional distress due to embarrassment and lack of appropriate social status. Hence, early detection of epileptic seizures can help the patients and improve their quality of life. Screening techniques in the diagnosis of epileptic seizures comprise two important categories of functional and structural neuroimaging modalities [4–9]. The functional neu- roimaging modality provides important information about brain function during epileptic seizure occurrence for physicians and neurologists [4–9]. The structural neuroimaging modalities provide physicians with substantial information about the brain structure of individuals with epileptic seizures [4–9]. The most important functional neuroimaging tech- niques are EEG [5], magnetoencephalography (MEG) [6], positron emission tomography (PET) [7], single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) [7,10], functional MRI (fMRI) [4,11], electrocorticography (ECoG) [12], and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) [13]. In contrast, structural MRI (sMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are among the most signiﬁcant structural neuroimaging techniques [4,14]. In the diagnosis of epileptic seizures, functional neuroimaging modalities are more commonly applied than structural modalities [4–9]. Research on the diagnosis of epileptic seizures has indicated that EEG modalities are the most popular among physicians. The EEG signals are widely preferred as they are economical, portable, and show clear rhythms in the frequency domain [8,9]. The EEG provides the voltage variations produced by the ionic current of neurons in the brain, which indicate the brain’s bioelectric activity [15]. They need to be recorded for a long period of time to detect epileptic seizures. In addition, these signals are recorded in multiple channels, making the analysis complex. The EEG signals are also prone to artifacts generated by main power supply, electrode movement, and muscle tremor [16]. This will pose challenges to the physicians to diagnose epileptic seizures using noisy EEG signals.","What is the title, authors, citation, and publication details of the review article discussing Epileptic Seizures Detection Using Deep Learning Techniques?",en,"Title: ""Epileptic Seizures Detection Using Deep Learning Techniques: A Review""

"To resolve these difﬁculties, much research is being carried out to diagnose and predict epileptic seizures based on EEG modalities and other techniques such as MRI coupled with AI techniques [17,18]. AI techniques in the ﬁeld of epileptic seizures diagnosis have employed conventional machine learning and DL methods [19–22]. Many machine learning algorithms have been developed using statistical, time, frequency, time-frequency domain and nonlinear parameters to detect epileptic seizures [23,24]. In conventional machine learning techniques, the selection of features and classiﬁers is done by trial-and-error method [25,26]. One needs to have sound knowledge of signal processing and data mining techniques to develop an accurate model. Such models perform well for limited data. Nowadays, with the increase in the availability of data, machine learning techniques may not perform very well. Hence, the DL techniques, which are the state-of-art methods, have been employed [27,28]. DL models, unlike conventional machine learning techniques, require huge data in the training phase [29]. This is because these models have a large number of feature spaces, and in case of lack of data, they face the problem of overﬁtting [29]. In conventional machine learning algorithms, most simulations were executed in the Matlab software environment, but the DL models are usually developed using Python programming language with numerous open-source toolboxes. The python language with more freely available DL toolboxes has helped the researchers to develop novel automated systems, and there is greater accessibility of computation resource to everyone thanks to cloud computing. Figure 1 shows that the TensorFlow and one of its high-level APIs, Keras, Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 5780 3 of 33 are widely used for epileptic seizure detection using DL in reviewed works due to their versatility and applicability. Figure 1. Number of times each DL tool was used for automated detection of epileptic seizure by various studies. Since 2016, substantial research has been done to detect epilepsy using DL models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), deep belief networks (DBNs), Autoencoders (AEs), CNN-RNNs, and CNN-AEs [30–33]. The number of studies in this area using DL is growing as new efﬁcient models are proposed. Figure 2 provides the overview of number of studies conducted using various DL models from 2014 to 2021 in detecting epileptic seizures. Figure 2. Number of studies conducted using various DL models from 2014 until now (2021). It can be noted from Figure 2 that various DL models have been exploited in the diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Compared to other DL techniques, 2D-CNN and 1D-CNN models are the most widely used in epileptic seizures detection. Researchers have mostly employed 2D-CNN models to diagnose epilepsy. In the diagnosis of epileptic seizures Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 5780 4 of 33 using 2D-CNN models, EEG signals are ﬁrst converted into two-dimensional (2D) images using preprocessing methods such as short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Next, these images are applied to 2D-CNN networks. The second category comprises 1D-CNN models, which have achieved a special place among researchers for epileptic seizures detection. In this work, EEG signals are ﬁrst preprocessed (noise removal and normalization) and then applied to 1D-CNN networks. Simple implementation and high efﬁciency are among the most important advantages of this type of network. The keywords “EEG”, “MRI”, “Epilepsy”, “Epileptic Seizures”, and “Deep Learning” were used to search articles. These keywords were searched in various citation databases such as IEEE, Elsevier, Springer, Wiley, and ArXiv. Google Scholar was also used to search further. Figure 3 shows the number of accepted papers in each citation database. It is observed that the IEEE citation database contains the most accepted articles. Figure 3. Search strategy used. The main aims of this study are as follows: • Providing information on available EEG datasets; • Reviewing works done using various DL models for automated detection of epileptic seizures with various modality signals; • Introducing future challenges on the detection of epileptic seizures; • Analyzing the best performing model for various modalities of data. Epileptic seizures detection using DL is discussed in Section 2. Section 3 describes the non-EEG-based epileptic seizure detection. Hardware used for epileptic seizures detection is provided in Section 4. Discussion on the paper is outlined in Section 5. The challenges faced by employing DL methods for epileptic seizure detection are summarized in Section 6. Finally, the conclusion and future work are delineated in Section 7. 2. Epileptic Seizures Detection Based on DL Techniques Figure 4 illustrates the working of a computer-aided diagnosis system (CADS) for epileptic seizures using DL architectures. The input to the DL model can be EEG, MEG, ECoG, fNIRS, PET, SPECT, and MRI. Then, the signal is subjected to the preprocessing to remove the noise. These eliminated signals are used to develop the DL models. The performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, and speciﬁcity. Addi- tionally, a table combining all the works conducted on epileptic seizure detection using DL is presented in the table form in Appendix A of the paper. Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 5780 5 of 33 Figure 4. Block diagram of a DL-based CAD system for epileptic seizures. 2.1. Dataset Datasets play an important role in developing accurate and robust CADS. Multiple EEG datasets, namely, Freiburg [34], CHB-MIT [35], Kaggle [36], Bonn [37], Flint-Hills [26], Bern-Barcelona [38], Hauz Khas [26], and Zenodo [39], are available to develop the auto- mated epileptic seizure detection systems. The signals from these datasets are recorded either intracranial or from the scalp of humans or animals. 2.1.1. Fribourg The EEG dataset contains invasive EEG signals from 21 patients suffering from re- fractory focal epilepsy which were recorded during pre-surgical epilepsy monitoring at the epilepsy center of the University Hospital Fribourg. To provide direct recording from focal area, reduction of artifacts and achieving higher Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), the in-tra-cortical grid, strip, and depth electrodes were used. The EEG signals were recorded using 128-channel Neuroﬁle NT system with 6 contacts electrodes (three focal and three extra focal) and digitized by a 16bits A/D with sample rate of 256 Hz.","What are the current advancements in diagnosing and predicting epileptic seizures, and how do deep learning techniques compare to conventional machine learning methods in this field?",en,"The current advancements in diagnosing and predicting epileptic seizures involve the use of Electroencephalography (EEG) modalities, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. In particular, AI techniques have been applied to the diagnosis of epileptic seizures using conventional machine learning and Deep Learning (DL) methods. While many machine learning algorithms have been developed to detect epileptic seizures, they often rely on a trial-and-error method for feature selection and require a good understanding of signal processing and data mining techniques.

Deep learning models, in contrast, are the state-of-the-art methods that have emerged as an alternative due to the increase in available data. Deep learning models require large amounts of data during their training phase because they have numerous feature spaces. In comparison, deep learning models tend to perform better than conventional machine learning techniques but may face issues with overfitting when there is a lack of data. Notably, deep learning models are typically developed using the Python programming language with various open-source toolboxes, while most simulations for conventional machine learning techniques have been executed in Matlab software environment.","Current advancements in epileptic seizure diagnosis and prediction use EEG modalities, MRI, and AI techniques. Deep Learning outperforms conventional Machine Learning due to its ability to handle large data quantities, reducing overfitting issues."
"For each patient, there are ictal and interictal data, the former contains seizures with at least 50 minutes’ of the pre-ictal region and the latter contains about 24 h of EEG data without seizure [34]. 2.1.2. CHB-MIT The database comprises 844 h of continuous recording of scalp EEG signals with 163 seizures from 23 children, recorded according to intentional 10–20 standard electrode positions and sampled at 256 samples per second. The inter-ictal region is deﬁned as the period between at least 4 h before the onset seizure and 4 h after the seizure ended. There are two types of seizures, called combined and main seizures, available in this database. The former are multiple seizures close to each other, while the later are great seizures considered for prediction. Generally, the prediction is meaningful for patients having less than 10 seizures per day. In this database, there are sufﬁcient data available (at least three main seizures and 3 h inter-ictal recording) from 13 patients [35]. Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 5780 6 of 33 2.1.3. Kaggle The database is the epileptic seizures prediction challenge of the American Epilepsy Society and contains intracranial EEG signals from ﬁve dogs and two patients with 48 seizures and 627 h total duration. The EEG signals of dogs were acquired by 16 implantable electrodes, which were sampled at 400 KHz, while the EEG signals from patient 1 and patient 2 were recorded using 15 deep and 24 subdural electrodes, respectively, with sample rate of 5 KHz. In this database, 10 min segments of pre-ictal and inter-ictal data are available, and for each seizure, six pre-ictal segments (with 10 s distance) up to ﬁve minutes before seizure onset are accessible. The inter-ictal segments are selected randomly at least one week before each seizure [36]. 2.1.4. Bonn Bonn database consists of ﬁve datasets, A, B, C, D, and E, each containing 100 single- channel EEG signals of 23.6 s duration. The EEG signals were digitized at a sample rate of 173.61 Hz by 12-bit A/D converter. Datasets A and B have the normal signals of ﬁve volunteers with eyes opened and closed states, respectively. The EEG signals of datasets C and D are related to pre-ictal region and were recorded from epileptogenic and left area of hippocampus, respectively. The EEG signals of E dataset are related to ictal region. Signals of datasets A and B were recorded using 10–20 scalp EEG standard, while the signals of C and D were intracranial EEG recorded using depth electrodes, and the signals of E were provided using both depth and strip electrodes. Depth electrodes are located symmetrically on hippocampus, while strip electrodes are located on lateral and base sections of neo cortex [37]. 2.1.5. Flint-Hills The database presents electrocardiography signals with total duration of 1419 h and sample rate of 249 Hz. In addition, meta information about 59 seizures and information related to the position of electrodes are presented. The signals of this database were obtained using 48 to 64 electrodes for each patient [26]. 2.1.6. Bern Barcelona Barcelona database was collected from the brain department of Bern Hospital of Barcelona and contains intracranial EEG of patients with focal epilepsy. Subjects were monitored for several days, and no antiepileptic drugs were used to determine seizures and possible surgery. The signals were acquired using AD-Tech intracortical electrodes, and one extra reference electrode based on 10–20 standard between PZ and FZ positions was used. The database contained two types of EEG signals: focal and extra focal EEG signals. Every dataset contained 3750 pairs of simultaneous recorded signals with duration of 20 s and sample rate of 512 Hz. The database consists of total 83 h EEG data from ﬁve patients with different ages [38]. 2.1.7. Hauz Khas The database was collected at a brain center in Delhi, India and comprises of scalp EEG signals of 10 patients, recorded with AS40 system and sampled at a rate of 200 Hz in Hauz Khas neurons. The signals were ﬁltered using band-pass ﬁlter with pass frequency of 0.5–70 Hz and classiﬁed as pre-ictal, inter-ictal, and ictal classes by neurologist experts [26]. 2.1.8. Zenodo This dataset contains multichannel EEG recordings of 79 human neonates collected in Helsinki University Hospital, with the median recording duration of 74 min. The EEG data were annotated by three experts, and every expert has annotated about 460 seizures, 39 neonates had seizure and 22 neonates were seizure-free in consensus [26]. The supplementary information on each dataset is listed in Table 1. Figure 5 shows the number of times each dataset employed epileptic seizures detection using DL techniques. Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 5780 7 of 33 It can be observed that the Bonn dataset is most widely used for automated detection of seizure using DL methods. Table 1.

Usage of various datasets for automated detection of seizure using DL techniques by various studies. 2.2. Preprocessing In developing CADS using DL models with EEG signals, the preprocessing involves three steps: noise removal, normalization, and signal preparation for DL network applica- tions [29,40]. In the noise removal step, ﬁnite impulse response (FIR) or inﬁnite impulse response (IIR) ﬁlters are usually used to eliminate extra signal noise. Normalization is then performed using various schemes such as the z-score technique. Finally, different time domain, frequency, and time–frequency methods are employed to prepare the signals for the deployment of deep networks.","What is the composition and characteristics of the CHB-MIT database, specifically regarding the number of patients, types of seizures, data length for ictal and interictal regions, and minimum requirements for available data for prediction purposes?",en,"The CHB-MIT database consists of continuous scalp EEG recordings from 23 children. The database contains a total of 844 hours of recordings, with 163 seizures recorded. These seizures can be categorized into two types: combined and main seizures. The former refers to multiple seizures that occur close to each other, while the latter are considered for prediction purposes, which is meaningful for patients having less than 10 seizures per day.

Regarding the data length for the ictal and interictal regions, the ictal data contains at least 50 minutes of pre-ictal region and seizure, while the interictal region is defined as the period between at least 4 hours before the onset of a seizure and 4 hours after it ends.

For prediction purposes, there should be sufficient data available, which includes at least three main seizures and 3 hours of inter-ictal recording from 13 patients. This information is based on the source [35].","The CHB-MIT database consists of 23 children's scalp EEG data, recorded over 844 hours with 163 seizures. There are two types: combined and main seizures. The ictal region contains at least 50 minutes of seizure data, while the inter-ictal region spans at least 4 hours before and after each seizure. For prediction purposes, data from at least 13 patients includes at least three main seizures and 3 hours of inter-ictal recording."
"2.3. Review of Deep Learning Techniques In contrast to conventional neural networks, or so-called shallow networks, deep neural networks are structures with more than two hidden layers. This increase in the Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 5780 8 of 33 size of the networks results in a massive rise in the number of parameters of the network, requiring appropriate methods for learning, and also measures to avoid overﬁtting of the learned network. Convolutional networks use ﬁlters convolved with input patterns instead of multiplying a weight vector (matrix), which reduces the number of trainable parameters dramatically. Furthermore, other methods are suggested to help the network to learn, as well [41]. Pooling layers reduce the size of the input pattern to the next convolutional layer. Batch normalization, dropout, early stopping, unsupervised or semi unsupervised learning, and regularization techniques prevent the learned network from overﬁtting and increase the learning ability and speed. The AE and DBN are employed as unsupervised learning and then ﬁne-tuned to avoid overﬁtting for limited labeled data. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRU) are RNNs capable of revealing the long-term time dependencies of data samples. 2.3.1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) CNNs are one class of the most popular DL networks to which most of the researches in machine learning have been devoted [30]. They were initially presented for image- processing applications, but have recently been adopted to one- and two-dimensional architectures for diagnosis and prediction of diseases using biological signals [42]. This class of DL networks is widely used for the detection of epileptic seizures using EEG signals. In two-dimensional convolutional neural networks (2D-CNN), the one-dimensional (1D) EEG signals are ﬁrst transformed into two-dimensional plots by employing visualization methods such as spectrogram [43], higher-order bispectrum [44,45], and wavelet trans- forms, and are then applied to the input of the convolutional network. In 1D architectures, the EEG signals are applied in the one-dimensional form to the input of convolutional networks. In these networks, changes are made to the core architecture of 2D-CNN that makes it capable of processing the 1D-EEG signals. Therefore, since both 2D and one- dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs) are used in the ﬁeld of epileptic seizures detection, they are investigated separately. A. 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (2D-CNNs) Nowadays, deep 2D networks are used for various medical applications such as diagnosis of COVID-19 in CT and X-ray [46,47], and autism spectrum disorders from MRI modalities [48]. First, in 2012, Krizovsky et al. [49] suggested this network to solve image classiﬁcation problems, and then quickly used similar networks for different tasks such as medical image classiﬁcation, in an effort to obviate the difﬁculties of previous networks and solve more intricate problems with better performance. Figure 6 shows a general form of a 2D-CNN used for epileptic seizure detection. The application of 2D-CNN architectures is arguably the most important architecture in the deep neural nets. More information about visualization and preprocessing method can be found in Appendix A. Figure 6. A typical 2D-CNN for epileptic seizure detection. Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 5780 9 of 33 In one study [50], the SeizNet 16-layer convolutional network is introduced, with additional dropout layers and batch normalization (BN) behind each convolutional layer having a structure similar to that of VGG-Net. The authors in [51] presented a new 2D-CNN model that can extract the spectral and temporal characteristics of EEG signals and used them to learn the general structure of seizures. Zuo et al. [52] developed the diagnosis of higher-frequency oscillations (HFO) epilepsy from 16-layer 2D-CNN and EEG signals. A DL framework called SeizureNet that uses convolution layers with dense connections is proposed in [53]. A novel DL model called the temporal graph convolutional network (TGCN) has been introduced by Covert et al. [54], comprising of ﬁve architectures with 14, 18, 22, 23, and 26 layers. Bouaziz et al. [55] split the EEG signals of CHB-MIT with 23 channels into 2 s time windows and then converted them into density images (spatial representation), which were fed as inputs to the CNN network. B. AlexNet FeiFei Li, Professor of Stanford University, created a dataset of labeled images of real- world objects and termed her project as ImageNet [56]. ImageNet organizes a computer vision competition called ILSVRC annually to solve the image classiﬁcation problems. Alex Krizhevsky revolutionized the image classiﬁcation world with his algorithm, AlexNet, which won the 2012 ImageNet challenge and started the whole DL era [49]. AlexNet won the competition by achieving the top-5 test accuracy of 84.6%. Taqi et al. [57] used the AlexNet network to diagnose focal epileptic seizures. This proposed network used the feature extraction approach and eventually applied the Softmax layer for classiﬁca- tion purposes and achieved 100% accuracy. In another study, the AlexNet network was employed [58]. They transformed the 1D signal to 2D image by passing through the Sig- nal2Image (S2I) module. The several methods used in this are signal as image, spectrogram, one-layer 1D-CNN, and two-layer 1D-CNN. C. VGG A research team at Oxford proposed the visual geometry group (VGG) model in 2014 [59]. They conﬁgured various models, and one such model was VGG-16, which was submitted to the ILSVRC 2014 competition. The VCG-16 comprises 16 layers and delivered an excellent performance for image classiﬁcation problems. Ahmedt-Aristizabal et al. [60] performed VGG-16 architecture to diagnose epilepsy from facial images. Their proposed approach attempted to extract and classify semiological patterns of facial states automati- cally. After recording the images, the proposed VGG architecture is trained primarily by well-known datasets, followed by various networks such as 1D-CNN and LSTM in the last few layers. In [58], the VGG network used one-dimensional and two-dimensional signals. To train the models, Adam’s optimizer and a cross-entropy error function were used. They used the batch size and number of epochs as 20 and 100, respectively. The idea of detecting epileptic seizures on the sEEG signal plots was examined by Emami et al. [61]. In the preprocessing step, the signals were segmented into different time windows and VGG-16 was used for classiﬁcation, using small (3 × 3) convolution ﬁlters to efﬁciently detect small EEG signal changes.","What are some strategies for training deep neural networks, specifically convolutional networks, to reduce overfitting and improve learning efficiency?",en,"Some strategies for training deep neural networks, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to reduce overfitting and improve learning efficiency include:
1. Pooling layers: These layers reduce the size of the input pattern to the next convolutional layer, thereby reducing the complexity of the network and preventing it from overfitting.
2. Batch normalization: This technique normalizes the inputs to a neural layer according to the mean and variance of its batch, which can help improve the learning speed and stability.
3. Dropout: By randomly dropping out neurons during training, dropout helps prevent overfitting by making the network more robust to noise and more generalizable.
4. Early stopping: This method stops the training process when the performance on a validation set starts to degrade, which can help avoid overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model.
5. Unsupervised or semi unsupervised learning: Techniques such as autoencoders (AE) and deep belief networks (DBN) can be used for unsupervised learning, followed by fine-tuning to avoid overfitting with limited labeled data.
6. Regularization techniques: These methods add a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights, which can help prevent overfitting and improve the learning ability of the network.","Strategies for training deep CNNs include: batch normalization, dropout, early stopping, unsupervised/semi-unsupervised learning, regularization techniques, pooling layers, and fine-tuning."
"This architecture was pre-trained by applying an ImageNet dataset to differentiate 1000 classes, and the last two layers had 4096 and 1000 dimensional vectors. They modiﬁed these last two layers to have 32 and 2 dimensions, respectively, to detect seizure and non-seizure classes. D. GoogleNet GoogLeNet won the 2014 ImageNet competition with 93.3% top-5 test accuracy [62]. This 22-layer network was called GoogLeNet to honor Yann Lecun, who designed LeNet. Before the introduction of GoogLeNet, it was stated that by going deep, one could achieve better accuracy and results. Nevertheless, the google team proposed an architecture called inception, which achieved better performance by not going deep but by better design. It represented a robust design by using ﬁlters of different sizes on the same image. In the Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 5780 10 of 33 ﬁeld of EEG signal processing to diagnose epileptic seizures, this architecture has recently received the attention of researchers. Taqi et al. [57] used this network in their preliminary studies to diagnose epileptic seizures. Their model was used to extract features from the Bern-Barcelona dataset and achieved excellent results. E. ResNet Microsoft’s ResNet won the ImageNet challenge with 96.4% accuracy by applying a 152-layer network that utilized a ResNet module [63]. In this network, residual blocks capable of training deep architecture were introduced by using skip connections that copied inputs of each layer to the next layer. The idea was to learn something different and new in the next layer. So far, little research has been accomplished on the implementation of ResNet networks to diagnose epilepsy, but this may grow signiﬁcantly in the coming days. Bizopoulos et al. [58] introduced two ResNet and DenseNet architectures to diagnose epileptic seizures and attained good results. They showed that S2I-DenseNet based model with an average of 70 epochs was sufﬁcient to gain the best accuracy of 85.3%. A summary of related works done using 2D-CNNs is shown in Table 2. A sketch of accuracy accuracy (%) obtained by various authors is shown in Figure 7. Table 2. Summary of related works done using 2D-CNNs.

F. 1D—Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) 1D-CNNs are intrinsically suitable for processing of biological signals such as EEG for epileptic seizures detection [2]. These architectures present a more straightforward structure, and a single pass of them is faster as compared with CNN with 2D architecture, due to fewer parameters. The most important superiority of 1D to 2D architectures is the possibility of employing pooling and convolutional layers with a larger size. In addition to that, signals are 1D in nature, and using preprocessing methods to transform them to 2D may lead to information loss. Figure 8 shows a general form of a 1D-CNN used for epileptic seizure detection. Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 5780 12 of 33 Figure 8. Typical sketch of the 1D-CNN model that can be used for epileptic seizure detection. The authors in [58] conducted experiments using 1D-LeNet, AlexNet, VGGnet, ResNet, and DenseNet architectures, and applied well-known 2D architectures in 1D space in the ﬁrst study in this section. In [80], 1D-CNN was used for feature extraction procedure. The researchers in [81] used 1D-CNN for other work. They used a CHB-MIT dataset, and the signals from each channel were segmented into 4 s intervals; overlapping segments were also accepted to increase the data and accuracy. Combining CNNs with conven- tional feature extraction methods was explored in [82]; they used the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method for feature extraction, and CNN was used to acquire high accuracy in the multiclass classiﬁcation tasks. In [83], a framework for the diagnosis of epileptic seizures is presented that combined the capability of interpreting probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) with advances in DL. The authors in [84] submitted a 1D-CNN architecture-deﬁned CNN-BP (standing for CNN bipolar). In this work, they used the data from patients monitored with combined foramen ovale (FO) electrodes and EEG surface electrodes. A new scheme to classify EEG signals based on temporal convolution neural networks (TCNN) was introduced by Zhang et al. [85]. Table 3 shows the summary of related works done using 1D-CNNs. Figure 9 shows the sketch of accuracy (%) obtained by various authors using 1D-CNN models for epileptic seizures detection. Figure 9.

Summary of related works done using 1D-CNNs.",What is the specific architecture used for detecting epileptic seizures in EEG signal processing and how does it differ from previous deep learning models to achieve better performance?,en,"The specific architecture used for detecting epileptic seizures in EEG signal processing is the Inception architecture. This model differs from previous deep learning models, such as ResNet and GoogLeNet, to achieve better performance not by going deeper but by using a better design. In particular, it employs filters of different sizes on the same image. This allows for more effective feature extraction from EEG signals compared to models that focus solely on depth.","The architecture used is GoogleNet (Inception), which differs by using filters of different sizes on the same image, enabling better performance without necessarily going deeper than previous deep learning models."

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) Sequential data such as text, signals, and videos show characteristics such as variable and great length, which makes them not suitable for simple DL methods [41]. However, these data form a signiﬁcant part of the information in the world, compelling the need for DL-based schemes to process these types of data. RNNs are the solution suggested to overcome the mentioned challenges, and are widely used for physiological signals. Figure 10 shows a general form of RNN used for epileptic seizure detection. In the following section, an overview of popular RNN models are presented in addition to the reviewed papers. A. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) The main problem of a simple RNN is short-term memory. RNN may leave out key information as it has a hard time transporting information from earlier time steps to the next steps in long-sequence data. Another drawback of RNN is the vanishing gradient problem [30–33]. The problem arises because of the shrinking of gradients as it back-propagates. To solve the short-term memory problem, LSTM gates were created [30]. The ﬂow of information can be regulated through gates. The gates can preserve the long Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 5780 14 of 33 sequence of necessary data, and throw away the undesired ones. The building block of LSTM is the cell state and its gates. Figure 10. Sample RNN model that can be used for seizure detection. In this section, Golmohammadi et al. [68] evaluated two LSTM architectures with three and four layers together with the Softmax classiﬁer in their investigation and ob- tained satisfactory results. In [92], three-layer LSTMs are used for feature extraction and classiﬁcation. The sigmoid active function is used in the last fully connected (FC) layer for classiﬁcation. According to directed experiments in [98], they employed two architectures: LSTM and GRU. The LSTM GRU model architecture is composed of a layer of Reshape, four layers of LSTM/GRU with the activator, and one layer of FC with sigmoid activator. In another work, Yao et al. [102] practiced ten different and independently ameliorated RNN (IndRNN) architectures and achieved the best accuracy using Dense IndRNN with attention (DIndRNN) with 31 layers. B. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) One variation of LSTM is GRU, which combines the input and forgets gates into one update gate [30–33]. It merges the input and forgets gates and also makes some other modiﬁcations. The gating signals are decreased to two. One is the reset gate, and another is the updating gate. These two gates decide which information is necessary to pass to the output. In one experiment, Chen et al. [92] used a three-layer GRU network with sigmoid classiﬁer and yielded 96.67% accuracy. Talathi et al. have used a new CADS based on GRU for epileptic seizure detection [103]. In the proposed method, during the preprocessing, the input signals are split into time windows and spectrogram are obtained from them. Then, these plots are fed to a four-layer GRU network with a Softmax FC layer in the classiﬁcation stage; 98% accuracy was achieved. In another study, Roy et al. [104] employed a ﬁve-layer GRU network with Softmax classiﬁer and achieved remarkable results. Table 4 provides the summary of related works done using RNNs. Figure 11 shows the sketch of accuracy (%) obtained by various authors using RNN models for seizure detection. Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 5780 15 of 33 Table 4.

Sketch of accuracy (%) obtained by authors using RNN models for seizure detection. 2.3.3. Autoencoders (AEs) AE is an unsupervised machine learning model for which the input is the same as output [30–33]. Input is compressed to a latent-space representation, and then the output is obtained from the representation. Therefore, in AE, the compression and decompression functions are coupled with the neural network. AE consists of three parts, i.e., encoder, code, and decoder. AE networks are most commonly used for feature extraction or dimensionality reduction in the brain signal processing. Figure 12 shows a general form of an AE used Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 5780 16 of 33 for epileptic seizures detection. As the ﬁrst research in this section, Rajaguru et al. [113] separately surveyed the multilayer AE (MAE) and expectation-maximization with principal component analysis (EM-PCA) methods to diminish the representation dimensions and then employed the GA for classiﬁcation. They obtained an average classiﬁcation accuracy of 93.78% when MAEs were applied for dimensionality reduction and combined with GA as classiﬁer. In another work, it was proposed to design an automated system based on AEs for the diagnosis of epilepsy using the EEG signals [114].","What is the difference between simple Deep Learning (DL) methods and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) when dealing with sequential data such as text, signals, and videos?",en,"Simple Deep Learning methods may not be suitable for sequential data like text, signals, and videos due to their variable and often great length. These characteristics make simple DL methods less effective because they are designed for fixed-size input data. In contrast, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are specifically designed to handle sequential data by allowing the network to have internal memory that can store information from previous steps or time-steps. This feature enables RNNs to process variable-length sequences and maintain context over long periods, making them a popular choice for processing sequential data in various applications such as physiological signals.","Simple DL methods struggle with variable length sequences, while RNNs are designed to handle this characteristic effectively."
"First, Harmonic wavelet packet transform (HWPT) was used to decompose the signal into frequency sub-bands, and then fractal features, including box-counting (BC), multiresolution BC (MRBC), and Katz fractal dimension (KFD), were extracted from each of the sub-bands. Figure 12. Sample AE network that may be used for seizure detection. A. Other Types of AEs To create a more robust representation, a number of schemes such as denoising AE (DAE) (which tries to recreate input from a corrupted form of it) [41], stacked AE (SAE) (stacking a few AEs on top of each other to go deeper) [41], and sparse AEs (SpAE) (which attempts to harness from sparse representations) [41] have been applied. These methods might pursue other objectives as well, for example, the DAE can be used to recover the corrupted input. Works in this section begin with Golmohammadi et al. [68], who presented various deep networks, one of which is stacked denoising AE (SDAE). Their architecture in this section consists of three layers, and the ﬁnal results demonstrated good performance of their approach. Qiu et al. [115] exerted the windowed signal, z-score normalization step of preprocessing EEG signals and imported preprocessed data into the denoising sparse AE (DSpAE) network. In their experiment, they achieved an outstanding performance of 100% accuracy. In [116], a high-performance automated EEG analysis system based on principles of machine learning and big data is presented, which consists of several parts. At ﬁrst, the signal features are extracted by linear predictive cepstral coefﬁcients (LPCC) coefﬁcients, then three paths are applied for precise detection. The ﬁrst pass is sequential decoding using hidden Markov models (HMMs), the second pass is composed of both temporal and spatial context analysis based on DL, and in the third pass, a probabilistic grammar is employed. In another study, Yan et al. [117] proposed a feature extraction and classiﬁcation method based on SpAE and support vector machine (SVM). In this approach, ﬁrst, the feature extraction of the input EEG signals is performed using SAE, and, ﬁnally, the classiﬁ- cation is performed by SVM. Another SAE architecture was proposed by Yuan et al. [118], which is namedWave2Vec. In the preprocessing stage, the signals were ﬁrst framed, and in the deep network segment, the SAE with Softmax was applied and achieved 93.92% accuracy. Following the experiments of Yuan et al., in [119], different stacked sparse de- Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 5780 17 of 33 noising AE (SSpDAE) architectures have been tested and compared. In this work, feature extraction is accomplished by the SSpDAE network and ﬁnally classiﬁcation by Softmax. They obtained an accuracy of 93.64%. Table 5 provides the summary of related works done using AEs. In addition, Figure 13 shows the comparison of the accuracies obtained by different researchers. Table 5.

Sketch of accuracy (%) versus authors obtained using AE models for seizure detection. 2.3.4. Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) is a variant of deep Boltzmann machines (DBM) and an undirected graphical model [30]. The unrestricted Boltzmann machines may also Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 5780 18 of 33 have connections between the hidden units. Stacking the RBMs forms a DBN; RBM is the building block of DBN. DBNs are unsupervised probabilistic hybrid generative DL models comprising latent and stochastic variables in multiple layers [30–33]. Furthermore, a variation of DBN is called convolutional DBN (CDBN), which could successfully scale the high-dimensional model and uses the spatial information of the nearby pixels [30–33]. DBNs are probabilistic, generative, unsupervised DL models which contain visible and multiple layers of hidden units [30–33]. Xuyen et al. [129] used DBN to identify epileptic spikes in EEG data. The proposed architecture in their study consisted of three hidden layers and achieved an accuracy of 96.87%. In another study, Turner et al. [130] applied the DBN network to diagnose epilepsy and found promising results. 2.3.5. Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CNN-RNNs) The highly efﬁcient combination of DL networks used to predict and detect epileptic seizures from EEG signals is the CNN-RNN architecture. Adding convolutional layers to RNN helps to ﬁnd spatially nearby patterns effectively as RNN characteristic is more suitable for time-series data. In [68], they applied numerous preprocessing schemes; then, a modiﬁed CNN-LSTM architecture was proposed comprising 13 layers and the sigmoid was used for the last layer. Finally, the proposed approach demonstrated better performance. Roy et al. [69] used different CNN-RNN hybrid architectures to improve the experi- mental results. Their ﬁrst network comprised a one-dimensional seven-layer CNN-GRU convolution architecture, and the second one is a three-dimensional (3D) CNN-GRU net- work. In another work, Roy et al. [104] concentrated on natural and abnormal brain activities and suggested four different DL architectures. The proposed ChronoNet model was developed using previous models. It achieved 90.60% and 86.57% training and test accuracies, respectively. Fang et al. [131] used the Inception-V3 network. At the outset, a preliminary train- ing was used on this network. Then, to ﬁne-tune this architecture, an RNN- based net- work called spatial temporal GRU (ST-GRU) was applied, and achieved 77.30% accuracy. Choi et al. [132] proposed a multiscale 3D-CNN with RNN model for the detection of epileptic seizures. The CNN module output is applied as the input of the RNN module. The RNN module consists of a unilateral GRU layer that extracts the temporal feature of epileptic seizures, which are ﬁnally classiﬁed using an FC layer.","What are the different types of autoencoders (AE) that have been applied to create a more robust representation for seizure detection, and what is the specific purpose or function of each type mentioned?",en,"The different types of Autoencoders (AE) that have been applied to create a more robust representation for seizure detection are denoising AE (DAE), stacked AE (SAE), and sparse AEs (SpAE). Each type serves a specific purpose or function:

1. Denoising AE (DAE): Its primary objective is to recreate the input from a corrupted form of it, thus helping in noise reduction or denoising of the signal.
2. Stacked AE (SAE): By stacking several AEs on top of each other, SAE goes deeper and can learn more complex patterns within the data. This is aimed at improving the robustness and representation capacity of the model.
3. Sparse AEs (SpAE): This type of autoencoder attempts to harness from sparse representations, which means it focuses on learning a smaller number of important features or coefficients that are most relevant for seizure detection. This can help reduce overfitting and improve generalization performance.","Denoising AE (DAE), Stacked AE (SAE), and Sparse AEs (SpAE) have been applied for robust seizure detection. DAE attempts to recreate input from a corrupted form, while SAE stacks multiple AEs for deeper learning. SpAE harnesses sparse representations."

Convolutional Autoencoders (CNN-AEs) In addition to ﬁnding nearby patterns, convolutional layers can reduce the number of parameters in structures such as AEs. These two reasons make their combination suitable for many tasks such as unsupervised feature extraction for epileptic seizure detection. A novel approach based on CNN-AE was presented by Yuan et al. [136]. At the feature extraction stage, two deep approaches, AE and 2D-CNN, were used to extract the supervised and unsupervised features, respectively. The unsupervised features were obtained directly from the input signals, and the supervised features were acquired from the spectrogram of the signals. Finally, the Softmax classiﬁer was utilized for classiﬁcation and achieved 94.37% accuracy. In another investigation, Yuan et al. [137] proposed an approach called deep fusional attention network (DFAN), which can extract channel-aware representations from multichannel EEG signals. They developed a fusional attention layer that utilized a fusional gate to fully integrate multiview information to quantify the contribution of each biomedical channel dynamically. A multiview convolution encoding layer, in combination with CNN, has also been used to train the integrated DL model.

Non-EEG-Based Epileptic Seizures Detection 3.1. Medical Imaging Various DL models were developed to detect epileptic seizure using sMRI, fMRI, and PET scans with or without EEG signals [141–148]. These models outperformed the conven- tional models in terms of automatic detection and monitoring of the disease. However, due to the nature and difﬁculties in using imaging methods, these models are mostly practiced for localization and detection of seizure. The authors of [141] proposed automatic localization and detection of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) from the MRI modality using a CNN model. The diagnosis of FCD rate is only 50% despite the progress in the analytics of MRI modalities. Gill et al. [142] proposed a CNN-based algorithm with feature learning capability to detect FCD automatically. The authors [143] designed DeepIED based on DL and EEG-fMRI scans for epilepsy patients, combining the general linear model with EEG-fMRI techniques to estimate the epilep- togenic zone. Hosseini et al. [144] proposed an edge computing autonomic framework for evaluation, regulation, and monitoring of epileptic brain. The epileptogenic network estimated the epilepsy using rs-fMRI and EEG. Shiri et al. [148] presented a technique for direct attenuation correction of PET images by applying emission data via CNN-AE. Nineteen radiomic features from 83 brain regions were evaluated for image quantiﬁcation via Hammersmith atlas. Finally, the summary of related works done using medical imaging methods and DL is shown in Table 8. 3.2. Other Neuroimaging Modalities Ravi Prakash et al. [135] introduced an algorithm based on DL for ECoG-based func- tional mapping (ECoG-FM) for eloquent language cortex identiﬁcation. However, the success rate of ECoG-FM is low as compared with electro-cortical stimulation mapping (ESM). In another work, Rosas-Romero et al. [149] have used fNIRS to detect epileptic seizure and obtained better performance than achieved using conventional EEG signals. Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 5780 21 of 33 Table 8.

Rehabilitation Systems for Epileptic Seizures Detection The high performance and robustness to noise have made the DL techniques suitable for commercial products. Nowadays various commercial products have been developed in the ﬁeld of DL, one of which is DL applications and hardware for diagnosing epileptic seizures. In the ﬁrst study investigated, the brain–computer interface (BCI) system was developed using an AE for epileptic seizure detection by Hosseini et al. [127]. In another study, Singh et al. [128] indicated a utilitarian product for the diagnosis of epileptic seizures, which comprised the user segment and the cloud segment. The block diagram of the proposed system presented by Singh et al. is shown in Figure 16. Figure 16. Block diagram of proposed epileptic seizure detection system using DL methods with EEG signals. Kiral-Kornek et al. [150] demonstrated that DL in combination with neuromorphic hardware could help in developing a wearable, real-time, always-on, patient-speciﬁc seizure warning system with low power consumption and reliable long-term performance.

Early detection of epileptic seizures is of substantial importance because it directly affects the patients’ quality of life and can enhance their self-conﬁdence at all stages of life. So far, much research has been accomplished to diagnose epileptic seizures using AI techniques.","What is the accuracy percentage of the different CNN-RNN models for seizure detection as shown in Table 6 and Figure 14 from the research presented in Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, and which specific model has the highest accuracy?",en,"The accuracy percentages of different CNN-RNN models for seizure detection as shown in Table 6 from the research presented in Int.

The model with the highest accuracy is ChronoNet at 90.60%."
"The objective of these studies is to assist physicians in accurate epileptic seizures diagnosis. AI research involves conventional machine learning [151] and DL [152–156] scopes. Until recently, many machine learning methods that were adopted to automatically detect seizures could not be seriously used for a variety of real-time diagnostic aid tools for epileptic seizures due to their disadvantages. DL is one of the state- of-the-art ﬁelds of epileptic seizure detection that has been employed for epileptic seizure detection since 2016. In recent years, the research growth in epileptic seizure diagnosis using DL is proceeding rapidly due to the simultaneous development of DL toolboxes as well as graphics processing units (GPUs). Applying DL techniques to diagnose epileptic seizures gives doctors hope that in the not-too-distant future a variety of rehabilitation tools will be developed for patients with epileptic seizures. Table A1 in the Appendix shows the overview of works done in this area. It also shows the type of dataset used, implementation tool, preprocessing, DL network, and evaluation methods utilized. As shown in this study, various DL structures are applied for epileptic seizure detec- tion, yet none of them has superiority over others. The best structure should be chosen carefully based on the dataset and problem characteristics, such as the need for real-time detection or minimum acceptable accuracy or even the use of pre-trained models. There are many databases available with different models. Hence, it is difﬁcult to compare them as they have been developed using different datasets and models. Overall, one of the most important advantages of DL algorithms is their high performance. Hence, such models have been widely used for many applications. Another advantage of DL methods is that they are robust to noise. Therefore, noise removal can be omitted in many applications. However, they need more data to train, and training takes time. Developing a robust model is time consuming and requires huge data. 6. Challenges There are several challenges in diagnosing epileptic seizures using neuroimaging modalities and DL procedures. Inaccessibility of datasets with high registration time is the ﬁrst challenge in this area. The datasets available for diagnosing epileptic seizures have a ﬁnite registration time (or recording), making it difﬁcult to conduct serious (or important) research in the ﬁeld of epileptic seizures. The complete datasets are not shared in the public domain, only a portion of the data may be available. Hence, real-time diagnosis of epileptic seizures is still challenging. However, research in the ﬁeld of real-time epileptic seizures diagnosis has been performed, using clinical data [157–159]. Due to the lack of accessible datasets, researchers have not yet been able to present a DL-based CADS for diagnosing epileptic seizures with optimum performance. Addition- ally, it is not possible to combine the available EEG datasets to enhance the efﬁciency of DL networks. This is because each of the datasets presented possesses different sampling fre- quencies, and in order to achieve higher detection accuracy, it is not pragmatic to integrate them to feed to DL networks. Table 1 shows all available EEG datasets used for epileptic seizure detection. However, other neuroimaging modalities such as MRI are used for epileptic seizures detection. In [141–148], MRI modalities coupled with DL methods have been used to diagnose epileptic seizures. Datasets with non-MRI modalities are not available, and this has led to limited research in this area. Therefore, providing datasets from other neuroimaging modalities is important to conduct research. Nowadays, DL models have made considerable advancements [160–164]. This has resulted in the development of computer hardware [165,166] that is expensive and not easily accessible to the researchers. Researchers working in the ﬁeld of epileptic seizures Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 5780 23 of 33 detection/prediction do not always have access to high-power hardware to implement novel DL models. Although powerful computing servers are available by Google, con- straints such as the amount of data that can be uploaded to these servers and execution time are still the challenges. 7. Conclusion and Future Works In recent years, a lot of research has been done in the epileptic seizures detection ﬁeld using artiﬁcial intelligence methods [167–175]. In this paper, a comprehensive review of works done in the ﬁeld of epileptic seizure detection using various DL techniques such as CNNs, RNNs, and AEs is presented. Various screening methods have been developed using EEG and MRI modalities. We have investigated the epileptic seizures detection using DL-based practical and applied hardware methods. It is very encouraging that much of the future research will concentrate on hardware—practical applications aid in the accurate detection of such diseases. The functional hardware has also been utilized to boost the performance of detection strategies. Furthermore, the models can be placed in the cloud by hospitals. Therefore, handheld applications, mobile or wearable devices, may be equipped with such models, and cloud servers will perform the computations; by taking beneﬁt from predictive models, these devices can be used to avert patients in a timely manner. Alert messages may be generated to the family, relatives, the concerned hospital, and doctor in the detection of epileptic seizures through the handheld devices or wearables, and thus the patient can be provided with proper treatment in time. Moreover, a cap with EEG electrodes in it can obtain the EEG signals, which can be sent to the model kept in the cloud to achieve real-time detection. Additionally, if we can detect early stage of seizure using interictal periods of EEG signals, the patient can take medication immediately and prevent seizure. This ﬁeld of research requires more research that combines different screening methods for more precise and fast detection of epileptic seizures and also applies semi supervised and unsupervised methods to further overcome the dataset size limits. Finally, having publicly available comprehensive datasets can help to develop an accurate and robust model that can detect the seizure in the early stage.

These methods are part of the state-of-the-art field of epileptic seizure detection that has been in use since 2016. The rapid growth in research on epileptic seizure diagnosis using DL is due to the simultaneous development of DL toolboxes and graphics processing units (GPUs).

The application of these techniques gives doctors hope that, in the not-too-distant future, a variety of rehabilitation tools will be developed for patients with epileptic seizures. These tools could potentially help improve the management and treatment of epilepsy, providing better outcomes for affected individuals. It is essential to note that while several DL structures are applied for epileptic seizure detection, no single structure has proven superiority over others. The best structure should be chosen carefully based on factors such as the dataset and problem characteristics, including real-time detection requirements, minimum acceptable accuracy levels, or the use of pre-trained models.","Recent advancements in DL for epileptic seizure detection include rapid research growth since 2016, driven by the development of DL toolboxes and GPUs.

INTRODUCTION Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that affects an estimated 65 million people worldwide, characterised by recurring unprovoked seizures due to an abnormal, hypersynchronous discharge between communicating neurons [1]. Epidemiological studies suggest that approximately 30% of patients with epilepsy (PWE) are refractory to common therapeutic treatments, which increases the risk of a sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). SUDEP is the leading cause of premature death observed in patients diagnosed with refractory epilepsy and is defined as a death in epilepsy that is not attributable to trauma, drowning or status epilepticus [2]. Although the underlying etiology behind SUDEP remains un- known, studies show that in 67% of cases, there were indications of a generalised seizure preceding the terminal event [3] [4]. Additionally, there is evidence to indicate that seizure-induced perturbations in respiratory, cardiac, and electrocerebral functions, along with several potential predisposing risk factors, could contribute to SUDEP [5]. Lamberts et al found that 58% of SUDEP cases were associated with sleep, and that 86% of instances occurred when the PWE was alone and unsupervised [6]. Sveinsson et al’s analysis of 321 SUDEP cases yielded similar findings, with most instances occurring at night in the patient’s home whilst living alone (71%) [6]. While similar J.

These findings indicate that such factors significantly increase the likelihood of SUDEP, with studies concluding that up to 69% of cases could have been prevented if patients were not left unattended at night. Despite an increase in clinical studies, little progress has been made in characterising SUDEP risk factors and the underlying mechanisms leading to premature death in epilepsy [7] [8]. This has led numerous studies to postulate that seizure detection could serve as a means to deter terminal seizures pre-ictal, and reduce the incidence of SUDEP cases through early intervention and prevention. II. RELATED WORK The electroencephalogram (EEG) represents the diagnostic gold standard modality for capturing seizures within hospital settings, employing continuous electrical brain wave monitoring over an extended period. However, the EEG’s utility as an assistive diagnostic tool is unsuitable outside of a hospital or epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) due to the need for a PWE to remain in a stationary position with multiple scalp-based electrodes attached, and a full- time neurodiagnostic technician to interpret real-time neurological activity. To overcome the limitations associated with EEG, a new sub-field of research has emerged known as non-EEG detection. This approach utilises non-invasive methods to detect seizures in real-world environments. These methods include wearable devices that measure physiological signals such as heart rate, movement and electrodermal activity. The accelerometer (ACM) has emerged as the most promising non-EEG sensing modality, having been extensively explored in non-EEG research for capturing changes in motion and velocity displayed by PWE.","What is the purpose and significance of the Open Seizure Database and Toolkit introduced in this research paper, and what unique contribution does it make to the field of non-electroencephalogram seizure detection research?",en,"The purpose of the Open Seizure Database and Toolkit, as introduced in this research paper, is to serve as a publicly accessible resource aimed at advancing research into non-electroencephalogram (non-EEG) seizure detection. This unique contribution lies in its extensive multimodal sensor data from 49 participants in real-world, in-home environments, making it the first openly accessible database of its kind.

Furthermore, it includes 348 labelled false alarms, such as common human movements and activities, to aid in the development and training of seizure detection models using machine and deep learning practices. The Open Seizure Toolkit is designed to facilitate this process by streamlining data from the Open Seizure Database for rapid development, training, and deployment of seizure detection models on the Open Seizure Detector Android app.","The Open Seizure Database and Toolkit aim to advance non-EEG seizure detection research.

"Notably, these investigations have showcased the ACMs potential for detecting rhythmic movements, particularly those associated with a generalised tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures. By leveraging ACM data, sophisticated algorithms have been developed to identify the convulsive movements characteristic of a seizure’s clonic phase. Seminal studies conducted by Conradsen et al. and Lockman et al, serve as notable examples, demonstrating the practical application of ACM-based detection with remarkable accuracies of 90% and 91% respectively [9] [10]. However, it is important to note that the ACM data utilised in these studies did not originate from patients diagnosed with epilepsy; rather, it was simulated by healthy participants in controlled short- term studies. This prevailing trend is widespread in the field of non- EEG seizure detection, as a significant portion of studies have relied on small-scale, simulated, or synthetic datasets [16]. Two predominate factors contribute to this observation. Firstly, the field of research in non-EEG detection is relatively new, and as such, there are no established, publicly available datasets, which are more common in other domains of healthcare research. Secondly, epileptic seizures are infrequent, rare events, which makes it challenging to record an extensive dataset of generalised seizure recordings from multiple PWE. 2 GENERIC COLORIZED JOURNAL, VOL.

However, upon closer examination, it becomes evident that a significant portion of the data is either simulated or recorded using sub-optimal sensing modalities, such as smartphones with embedded ACMs. Additionally, the existing data lacks the necessary depth to capture the complexities inherent in different types of epilepsy. To address this, non-EEG data should be recorded from real-world, in-home environments, as this is where most seizures and SUDEP cases occur. By utilising real-world data, non-EEG detection systems can be modelled to accurately reflect the real-world complexities encountered by PWE in their day to day lives. While publicly available non-EEG data remains limited, com- mercial organisations and international consortiums have conducted studies using several non-EEG detection techniques. Empatica’s Embrace has been used in several studies to detect convulsive seizures, demonstrating an average sensitivity of 92-100% and a false alarm rate (FAR) between 0.2-1 per day [17] [18] [19] [20]. Another commercially available device, Seer Medical’s smartwatch has yielded a mean area under curve (AUC), a sensitivity, and a FAR per day of 0.98, 0.93, and 2.3, respectively for 19 motor seizures from 10 in-hospital patients [21]. However, it should be noted that the data used in these studies is not accessible to the wider academic community, limiting the ability to replicate these findings. Additionally, consideration should be given to the fact that the data used in these commercial studies predominantly originates from clinical trials conducted in EMUs, where the environmental dynamics are closely regulated [22] . The progress in non-EEG research is currently hindered by the lack of publicly available data, impeding scientific advancements and leading to slower progress compared to other fields utilising Machine Learning/Deep Learning techniques in clinical practice [23]. Additionally, non-EEG literature often demonstrates high accuracy scores but is accompanied by a significant occurrence of false positives. The presence of false alarms poses challenges in real- world seizure detection applications, as it can result in unnecessary alerts, incorrectly indicating the presence of a seizure [24]. Reducing false alarms is crucial to enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of seizure detection models. The use of multimodal sensors shows promise in achieving this goal. By combining data from different sensors, a more accurate and robust dataset can be constructed for the development of intelligent detection models. Several studies have suggested that multimodal sensing could decrease the false positive rate observed in literature and improve the accuracy and performance of existing seizure detection models. To achieve these goals there is a pressing need for a large-scale in-home study to record multimodal sensor data. By recording individuals with epilepsy in their real-world home environments using multiple sensors, a comprehensive dataset could be created, offering sufficient depth and breadth to tackle the current challenges in non-EEG seizure detection research. Large-scale data repositories and collaborative data sharing have become integral to clinical progress. In epilepsy research, the Euro- pean Epilepsy Database (EED) is the largest and most comprehensive database for human surface and intracranial EEG recordings. It contains clinically annotated pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal EEG data from 278 patients suffering from pharmaco-resistant partial epilepsy [25] [26]. Through collaborative sharing and centralised data access, the EED has been cited in over 138 publications, facilitating research progress in the field of EEG detection [25]. However, the EED stores data strictly for neurological research and does not store any non-EEG resources. A publicly available non-EEG database dedicated to storing sensor data from patients with epilepsy in real-world conditions holds great potential for transforming the field of seizure detection research. This approach would enable benchmark testing and comparative analysis under reproducible conditions, facilitating the evaluation and advancement of novel seizure detection techniques. Moreover, such a database could advance epilepsy research through data sharing and collaboration [27], enabling researchers to investigate innovative concepts such as patient-specific and seizure-specific detection. This paper is organised into the following sections: Section III details the development of the Open Seizure Database. Section IV outlines the Open Seizure Toolkit, highlighting its capacity to rapidly develop algorithms compatible with Open Seizure Detector.","What are the two predominant factors that contribute to the widespread trend in non-EEG seizure detection studies of relying on small-scale, simulated, or synthetic datasets instead of using data from patients diagnosed with epilepsy?",en,"Les deux facteurs principaux qui contribuent à la tendance largement répandue dans les études de détection non-EEG de crises épileptiques de reposer sur des ensembles de données restreints, simulés ou synthétiques plutôt que sur des données provenant de patients diagnostiqués avec l'épilepsie sont: 1) la relative nouvellezza del campo della ricerca in non-EEG detection, il quale non dispone ancora di dati pubblicamente disponibili, che sono più comuni nelle altre aree della ricerca sanitaria; 2) le crise epilettiche sono eventi infrequenti e rari, il che rende difficile la raccolta di un vasto insieme di dati di registrazione delle crisi generalizzate da più PWE (personne con l'epilessia).",The two predominant factors are: 1) New field with few established datasets; 2) Infrequent nature of epileptic seizures in making extensive recordings from multiple patients.

In Section VI, a comprehensive discussion of this paper’s findings and finally, Section VII concludes by highlighting the studies impact on the field of non-EEG seizure detection. III. METHODOLOGY This study introduces the Open Seizure Database (OSDB) and Open Seizure Toolkit (OSTK) as novel contributions to the field of non-EEG seizure detection [28]. Developed in collaboration between Open Seizure Detector (OSD) [29] and the University of West Lon- don [30], the OSDB serves as the first publicly accessible database containing non-EEG epileptic seizure recordings from real-world, in- home environments. OSD, established in 2013, is the largest open- source seizure detection software package, distributed under the open- source, GNU General Public License (GPL), boasting over 5000 downloads [31], and an estimated 300 daily users [29]. A comprehensive beta trial was conducted, utilising non-invasive wearable sensing devices to capture non-EEG data from a diverse cohort of participants diagnosed with various forms of epilepsy. This beta trial, closely supervised by OSD, spanned from January to June 2022. In adherence to ethical standards, all participants provided informed consent [33], and voluntarily enrolled in the beta trial through the Google Play Services Public Beta Program [32]. Furthermore, this research study obtained approval from the ethics committee at the University of West London. J PORDOY et al. : PREPARATION OF BRIEF PAPERS FOR IEEE TRANSACTIONS AND JOURNALS (FEBRUARY 2017) 3 Fig. 1: An illustration of the Open Seizure Detector architecture used to record participant data. The architecture consists of four main components, Open Seizure Detector Android Application, Open Seizure Web Server, Open Seizure Database and the Open Seizure Toolkit To uphold strict confidentiality during the data collection process, stringent measures were implemented, encompassing the removal of personal identifiers to ensure anonymity. Subsequent to the beta trial period, the opportunity to contribute data to the database was extended to all OSD users who consented to the data safety statement. Notably, data collection remains ongoing to the present day. For the beta trial, individuals with partial-onset epilepsy, partic- ularly those susceptible to absence or complex focal seizures, were intentionally excluded during the initial phase of data collection. This decision was predicated on the absence of tonic, atonic, myoclonic, or clonic movements typically associated with generalised epilepsy. Consequently, among the participants who signed up to the beta trial, 49 individuals met the required criteria concerning both technological aspects, such as device and sensor compatibility, as well as physio- logical requirements pertaining to the type of epilepsy. Participants were instructed to install the OSD Android application [31] and continually wear a wrist-worn sensor device (Fig. 3), except when charging was required. Several Garmin devices (TABLE III) were employed for data collection, in which sensor data was transmit- ted to the participants Android device using a Bluetooth connection. Sensor data is then stored temporally on the end users device where it is analysed to detect seizure-like movement as described in Section III-F. When seizure-like movement is detected, the associated data is stored long term using the OSD web server (Fig. 1). A. Dataset During the 453 day data collection period, a total of 494 events were recorded from 49 participants. 146 events were recorded as epileptic seizures, while the remaining 348 were classified as false alarms. Among the false alarms, 302 were associated with human/- physical activities and were appropriately labelled as such (Fig. 2). The remaining 46 events were categorised as false alarms where the activity is unknown. Epileptic seizures were recorded from 18 participants, amounting to a cumulative duration of 5 hours and 51 minutes (TABLE II). A diverse range of epileptic seizures were recorded with 50 GTC seizures, 27 aura/focal seizures, 22 atonic seizures/falls and 47 seizures labelled as ”Other Seizure”. It is important to note that, for the purposes of this study, ”Other seizure” are defined as seizures that were labelled only by type (e.g. seizure or false alarm). Participants did not provide further categorisation of the events specific sub-types (e.g. atonic, aura, tonic-clonic). Fig. 2: Summary of the different events recorded. Epileptic-related events are highlighted in orange, while common human activities responsible for triggering false alarms are indicated in blue. B. Sensing Modalities Recording epileptic seizures from a large group of participants using multiple sensors is a significant challenge. To overcome this, we employed Garmin wearable devices, capable of measuring accelerom- etry, photoplethysmography (PPG), and pulse-oximetry (Sp02) sig- nals. The use of Garmin devices proved to be a cost-effective and easily accessible solution to record sensor data (Fig. 4) from a large cohort of participants with epilepsy in their real-world, home environments. This section details the sensors used during the study. Garmin wrist-worn devices are equipped with tri-axis ACM and have a sensing range of ±2 g up to ±16 g, where ’g’ quantifies the gravitational forces along different device axes [34]. This range signifies the maximum acceleration value accurately measurable by a Garmin device. The ±2 g range accommodates the broad spectrum of human movements and activities, while the ±16 g range can facilitate the detection of high intensity movements. For heart rate monitoring, Garmin devices are equipped with an embedded optical PPG sensor, located on the back, which utilises a green light-emitting diode to emit light onto the skin, thereby mea- suring volumetric variations in blood circulation [35]. The reflected light from the red blood cells in the skin facilitates the measurement of the participant’s heart rate in beats per minute (bpm). 4 GENERIC COLORIZED JOURNAL, VOL. XX, NO.

The OSDB serves as the first publicly accessible database containing non-EEG epileptic seizure recordings from real-world, in-home environments. The OSTK was developed in collaboration between the Open Seizure Detector (OSD) and the University of West London.

During the comprehensive beta trial, these contributions were utilized by using non-invasive wearable sensing devices to capture non-EEG data from a diverse cohort of participants diagnosed with various forms of epilepsy, over a period spanning from January to June 2022. All participants provided informed consent and voluntarily enrolled in the beta trial through the Google Play Services Public Beta Program. The research study obtained approval from the ethics committee at the University.","The study introduces the Open Seizure Database (OSDB) and Open Seizure Toolkit (OSTK), novel resources for non-EEG seizure detection.

These devices utilise two wavelengths of light, red and infrared, with red light being absorbed by oxygenated blood and infrared light by deoxygenated blood. By analysing the absorption ratio of these wavelengths, oxygen saturation levels can be calculated [36]. C. Data Storage To address the long-term data storage requirements, a mobile- client, client-server architecture was implemented. Short-term data J PORDOY et al. : PREPARATION OF BRIEF PAPERS FOR IEEE TRANSACTIONS AND JOURNALS (FEBRUARY 2017) 5 storage utilised an SQLite database on each participants Android device, leveraging local storage capabilities. Mobile Sync ensured efficient and reliable data synchronisation between the mobile client and the OSD web server. Sensor data was transmitted using Bluetooth in 5 second timesteps (intervals) to the on-device database, striking a balance between capturing sufficient information for seizure detection and minimis- ing energy consumption. Furthermore, the periodic transmission of locally stored data to the OSD Web Server was designed to prevent potential bottlenecks during the upload. The OSDB was designed to be flexible and maintain backward compatibility. Initially, it stored one-dimensional ACM data in the form of vector magnitude and heart rate data. However, during the beta trial, adjustments were made to accommodate the storage of SpO2 and three-dimensional ACM data. By utilising an SQLite database on the Android platform and integrating additional fea- tures and sensors, the OSD project achieved scalability and ensured compatibility. Design choices were driven by the goal of optimising data storage, capturing relevant sensor data, and improving overall performance. D. Database Schema The database schema for the OSDB was carefully anonymized and preprocessed, and the data was converted into a series of JSON scripts. The utilisation of JSON provided a structured representation of the data, ensuring accessibility across different platforms and programming languages. Version 1 of the OSDB is available upon request through the OSDB GitHub repository. It can be accessed either as a single JSON script containing data for all labelled events or as a subset focusing on specific event types such as tonic-clonic or false alarms. The datasets are organised hierarchically using a one-to-many relationship, where each event has multiple sub-events. Each sub-event corresponds to a 5-second timestep, and sensor data for that timestep is stored as a JSON array called ”Datapoints.” The complete JSON schema of the OSDB, including accurate attribute names, arrays, and data types, is provided in Fig. 5 and TABLE IV. E. Annotating Event Labels As the beta trial had a diverse cohort of participants spread across the globe, a self-annotation system was developed where participants were able to label an event as it occurred using the OSD Android application. When an event was detected, participants were instructed to label the event by type (e.g., Seizure, false alarm) and then sub-type (e.g., aura, tonic-clonic). Participants had the flexibility to add custom class labels for more accurate annotation or choose from a predefined set of labels commonly associated with false alarms. Additionally, participants had the option to manually trigger an alarm and label an event in cases where the algorithm failed to detect a seizure.

XX, NO. XX, XXXX 2017 F. Open Seizure Detector Algorithm For seizure detection during the beta trial, participants were in- structed to use the OSD Android application which runs a deter- ministic detection algorithm. Sensor data was transmitted from the participants’ Garmin device to the OSD application in five second timesteps at a sample frequency of 25 Hz, resulting in 125 measure- ments per timestep. To optimise the battery capacity of participants Android devices, acceleration was in measured as a unit of vector magnitude instead of measuring three separate spatial dimensions (x, y, z), thus reducing the computational requirements by a factor of 2 3. This decision was made to increase the data collection duration without the need for frequent battery replacement or recharging. Vector magnitude for the current timestep can be calculated as At = q (a2 x−t + a2 y−t + a2 z−t) (1) Where ax−t, ax−t and ax−t represent the moving acceleration of each orthogonal axis for timestep (t). The algorithm then transforms the vector magnitude signal from the time domain to the frequency domain by utilising a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to compute the power in each frequency range. As stated by the Nyquist Theorem, the maximum frequency that can faithfully represent the original signal is half of the sample frequency [37]. Consequently, the OSD algorithm running on a Garmin device is capable of precisely reconstructing signals with frequencies up to 12.5 Hz without experiencing aliasing. If the algorithm detects a participant moving at a frequency exceeding 12.5 Hz, the resulting observation will manifest as an alias feature in the spectrum. However previous studies have reported that common human movement predominantly occur within a frequency range between 0-12.5 Hz [38]. Given this observation, we posit that any high-frequency movement beyond the 12.5 Hz threshold will exert minimal influence on algorithmic performance, as it lies outside the typical range of human movement. Furthermore, studies have shown that during the clonic phase the body’s major muscle groups exhibit repetitive convulsions at a frequency range between 3-8 Hz, which is inside the algorithms detectable frequency range [39] [40]. The frequency resolution of the spectrum is then determined by di- viding the sample frequency (25 Hz) by the number of measurements (125) per timestep, resulting in a resolution of 0.2 Hz. This resolu- tion allows for effective detection and differentiation of frequency components with a precision of 0.2 Hz. These calculations indicate that the algorithm can accurately identify frequency components that are spaced at intervals of 0.2 Hz, however any frequency differences smaller than this value may not be distinguishable [41]. To detect a ’seizure-like’ movement, the algorithm calculates the average power for the whole spectrum (Ps) and then the average power of the 3-8 Hz Region of Interest (Proi) for each timestep. To reduce the FAR, (Ps) is checked against a threshold to ensure that there is a sufficient level of movement, thus avoiding spurious alarms caused by measurement noise when there is minimal movement. If the movement detected exceeds the movement threshold, then Rroi is calculated as the ratio between (Proi) and (Ps) which can be expressed as Rroi = Proi Ps (2) A seizure is then detected if Rroi ≥the algorithms sensitivity threshold. If the sensitivity threshold is exceeded for three consecutive timesteps, an alarm state is raised, and the data saved to the database. Three consecutive timesteps (15 seconds) were utilised to give bal- ance between reducing false alarms and ensuring prompt generation of an alarm when a genuine seizure was detected. The above process is detailed in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 Pseudo code for the OSD algorithm where At = acceleration (vector magnitude) at timestep t, Ps = spectrum power, Proi = Region of Interest power, Rroi = ROI Ratio, Th = threshold. DoAnalysis takes At as an input parameter on a repeating loop every 5 seconds. The acceleration values are passed to a FFT to convert values into the frequency domain. For each timestep t the average of Ps and Proi are calculated to find the ratio of Rroi. If Rroi ≥Th, ’seizure-like’ movement is detected where SD = Seizure Detected and AS = Alarm State.

XX, NO. XX, XXXX 2017 Fig. 7: A hierarchical overview of the file structure and core compo- nents of the Open Seizure Database and Open Seizure Toolkit IV. THE OPEN SEIZURE TOOLKIT The Open Seizure Toolkit is a software package developed by OSD, serving to facilitate data access to the OSDB, enabling the analysis and development of seizure detection models compatible with the OSD Android application. Fig.7 depicts the hierarchical structure of the OSTK, which encompasses three primary components (NN Trainer, Test Runner, and Data Summariser) located in the User Tools directory. To access the OSDB, users are required to clone the OSTK repository from the official OSD GitHub Repository. Additionally, data access requires user registration with OSD and compliance with the guidelines specified in the OSDB licence [43]. The following section illustrates the functionality of the OSTK by conducting a series of experiments to developing a basic seizure detection model compatible with the OSD Android application. For this experiment a subset of 190 events were selected from 16 participants diagnosed with different epilepsy types. A. Preprocessing and Data Engineering By utilising the OSTK WebApi connector, data was extracted as a JSON string and subsequently transformed by flattening the hierarchical structure of the data’s nested objects and loaded as a dataframe for manipulation. Data cleaning, analysis, and feature engineering were conducted to prepare the data for classification. To address the issue of imbalanced data, random oversampling was applied to the minority class. In order to mitigate the effects of data duplication resulting from oversampling, Gaussian noise was introduced to the ACM data as a form of data augmentation, thereby enhancing the variability among samples. B. Class Relabelling and One Hot Encoding In this experiment, one-hot encoding was used to convert 24 class categorical class labels into a binary vector representation. The resulting binary vectors contain all zero values except for the index corresponding to the class label, which is set to 1. The nnTrainer.py and processing pipeline.py scripts were then used to partition the subset into a 75:25 split for the training and test sets, respectively. C. Neural Network Trainer In this experiment, a 1-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) was developed, featuring four convolutional blocks la- belled as b1, b2, b3, b4, each with an associated filter size of 64, Fig. 8: Architectural schematic of 1D Convolutional Neural Network 128, 128, and 256, respectively, providing varying levels of recep- tivity (Fig.8). Each block contains a convolutional layer with ReLU activation and batch normalisation to capture spatial dependencies. Furthermore, a max pooling layer was added to each block to reduce spatial dimensionality. The output vector from b4 is flattened and fed into the models classification block which has three dense layers. The first two dense layers contain 128 fully connected neurons with ReLU activation units, while the third layer incorporates a softmax activation function to produce an output vector of multiple probabilities. Cate- gorical cross-entropy loss was used to optimise the learning process in conjunction with the Adam optimisation technique. To enhance numerical stability, the optimiser’s epsilon score and learning rate were reduced to 1e-05 and 0.0001, respectively. The toolkit can be used to visualise the models learning rate by plotting accuracy and loss scores for training and validation sets (Fig.9-10).

EXPERIMENTS & RESULTS This section presents the experiments conducted using the OSTK and and the results achieved. The 1D CNN was trained for 50 epochs, and recorded accuracy and loss scores of 0.959 and 0.1412 receptivity. The model was then evaluated on an unseen test set, and recorded an accuracy score of 92.75% with 0.298 loss. A full breakdown of the models overall performance is detailed in TABLE VII. The OSTK Data Summariser was utilised to plot a multi-class confusion matrix, visualising the model’s predicted and ground truth labels for the 24 classes used in these experiments. An analysis of the confusion matrix demonstrated how well the model distinguishes between the different classes. For the ”O Seizure” class, 810 true positives (TP) were accurately detected, however, 48 instances of ”Tonic-Clonic,” 15 ”Aura/focal,” and 58 ”Atonic/fall” were misclassified. Additionally, 8 instances were labelled as ”Sleeping” and 13 as ”Other”. Further analysis of the ”Tonic-Clonic” class classified 743 TP in- stances. However, 7 instances were misclassified as ”Other Seizure,” 7 as ”Aura/focal” and 18 as ”Atonic/fall”. Furthermore, 14 instances were incorrectly labelled as common human movements, with 9 instances labelled as ”Sleeping” and 5 as ”Other”. An analysis of the ”Atonic/fall” class revealed 734 TP instances, with only 2 instances inaccurately classified as ”Aura/focal”. More- over, a single instance each of ”Tonic-Clonic” and ”Unknown” were misclassified, whilst there were no incorrect classifications associated with the ”Other Seizure” class. These results demonstrate the model’s ability to differentiate between ”Atonic/fall” and ”Other Seizure” classes. For the ”Aura/focal” class, the model accurately identified 897 TP instances. However, 56 instances were incorrectly labelled as ”Atonic/focal”, 25 as ”Other Seizure” and 115 as ”Tonic-Clonic”. A further 13 labels were incorrectly classified as ”Unknown”, 27 as ”sleeping” and 60 as ”Other”. However, these findings were expected, as a considerable proportion of GTC seizures exhibit an aura (pre- ictal) phase. A further analysis shows that GTC seizures have an average clonic phase lasting 25 to 35 seconds after generalisation. Therefore a degree of similarity between these classes is to be expected and highlights the importance of considering the dynamics of each sub-event. Overall the model has demonstrated a clear ability to differentiate between the ”Other Seizure” and ”Atonic/fall” classes, as well as ”Aura/focal” and ”Atonic/fall”. However, there were chal- lenges distinguishing between the ”Tonic-Clonic” and ”Aura/focal” classes.

For the purpose of these experiments, the results will be focused on the four classes of seizure. For the ”Tonic-Clonic” class denoted in the results as c21, the model achieved a precision score of 0.94 and a recall of 0.77. These metrics signify that 86% of positive predictions were correct, while the recall indicates that 23% of true instances of c21 were incorrectly classified. For c2 (Aura), the model demonstrated a precision of 0.75, indicating that 75% of the instances predicted were correct. However the recall score of 0.93 highlights the model’s ability to correctly identify 93% of actual instances of c2. An analysis of c1 (Atonic/fall) recorded a precision score of 0.99, signifying that 99% of the instances predicted as c1 were true instances. Nonetheless, a recall score of 0.76 suggests that the model is overcompensating and classifying to many instances of c1, which has lead to a trade-off between the precision and recall scores. For c4 (Other Seizure), the model displayed a balanced performance, recording a precision, recall, and F1-score of 0.84. A precision score of 84% indicates a relatively low false positive rate and demonstrates a high level of accuracy when classifying classifying TP instances of c4. Furthermore, a recall score of 84% demonstrated the number of true instances correctly classified by c4. To provide a comprehensive assessment, an F1-score was computed for each class type, resulting in values of 0.86, 0.83, 0.84, and 0.85 for c1, c2, c4 and c21, respectively. F1-score results indicate a realistic trade-off between correctly identifying positive instances (recall) and minimising false positives (precision) for each class. In summary, the model’s performance demonstrates a clear ability to accurately classify seizure-related classes while maintaining a balance between precision and recall.

"The primary objective of this research is to address the scarcity of resources in the field of non-EEG seizure detection by establishing the OSDB as the first openly accessible database encompassing non-EEG sensor data from multiple sensing modalities. This study distinguishes itself by utilising real-world data, provid- ing an accurate depiction of everyday life compared to controlled EMU-based datasets. The beta trial’s success led to an indefinite extension of the data collection period, showcasing our commitment to continually enriching the OSDB and contributing to non-EEG seizure detection research. The initial version of the OSDB is comprised of 494 events collected over 453 days, with each event labelled and optimised for machine/deep learning. Among these events, 146 epileptic seizures were recorded; 50 GTC seizures, 47 Other seizures, 27 aura/focal, and 22 atonic/falls. The cumulative duration of recorded epileptic events amounts to 5 hours, 51 minutes, making it the most extensive publicly available cohort of non-EEG seizure data to date. Additionally, 302 common human movements that triggered false alarms during the data collection period were recorded and labelled. A further 46 events were classified as false alarms, where the triggering activity remains unidentified. The inclusion of labelled false alarms in the dataset offers a valuable resource to address the challenge of false positives in non-EEG seizure detection. A. Future Research The introduction of the OSDB sets forth several possibilities for future research. As the data collection process is extended indefinitely, individuals with epilepsy can continue to participate and contribute data. As more data is collected, the exploration of novel techniques such as patient-specific and seizure-specific detection becomes a possibility. However, due to the dataset’s current size, dedicated classification models cannot be trained for these concepts yet. Nev- ertheless, as more data accumulates over time, these concepts will become feasible. VII. CONCLUSION In conclusion, the introduction of the OSDB and OSTK represents a significant milestone in non-EEG seizure detection research, providing a valuable resource to overcome existing scarcity in this domain. With real-world data collected from in-home environments, researchers can explore diverse multimodal approaches for seizure detection. The OSDBs extensive data on epileptic seizures and labelled false alarms presents a unique opportunity to advance the field. With continued data collection and exploration of novel techniques, the OSDB and OSTK has the promise of establishing a non-EEG gold standard and ultimately improving seizure detection techniques. Researchers investigating non-EEG detection can access the dataset, code, and models through the official OSDB GitHub repository. Acknowledgements: A heartfelt thank you to all the participants.

"Project 1 Project title: Benchmarking Medical Language Models for analysing Electronic Health Records Supervisor: Anuradha Kar Brief description The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is transforming the way medical information is processed, analyzed, and utilized. Among the various AI applications, medical language models (MLMs) have emerged as critical tools for understanding and interpreting electronic health records (EHRs). These records, comprising unstructured clinical notes, laboratory results, prescriptions, and imaging reports, offer valuable insights but pose significant challenges due to their complexity, variability, and sensitivity. This project focuses on benchmarking medical language models tailored for EHRs to evaluate their performance, reliability, and applicability in clinical settings. The benchmarking process will involve the following key components: 1.​ Steps: ○​ Identifying state-of-the-art MLMs, such as Med-BERT, ClinicalBERT, or BioGPT. ○​ Curating EHR datasets representative of real-world clinical environments. ○​ Evaluating models based on accuracy, interpretability, efficiency, and generalization across tasks like information extraction, clinical entity recognition, and note summarization. ○​ Assessing use cases such as decision support, risk prediction, and patient stratification. ●​ Expected outcomes: The project aims to identify strengths and limitations of existing MLMs, providing guidance for their optimization and deployment in healthcare systems. By establishing standardized benchmarks, the project will facilitate the development of more reliable, efficient, and interpretable models that align with the specific demands of EHRs. This research will significantly contribute to improving clinical workflows, enabling personalized medicine, and enhancing patient care. ●​ Required skills or prerequisites (if any): Python, LLM, Huggingface Project 2 Project title: Multimodal AI for indoor monitoring for Parkinson's disease patients Supervisor: Anuradha Kar Brief description : This project leverages multimodal AI to improve the quality of life and clinical outcomes for Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients through continuous, non-invasive indoor monitoring. Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that impairs motor functions, balance, and speech, requiring tailored interventions.

"mjn-SERAS 1.​Description: ​ mjn-SERAS is a highly specialized fine technology from Epilepsyalarms in England for seizure detection. The mjn-SERAS monitors brain activity and uses artificial intelligence to alert users and carers of an imminent seizure, 1-3 minutes notice before an episode occurs. Over time, using highly sophisticated sensors that learn from the user’s brain activity, the mjn-SERAS can predict imminent seizures even sooner. (continuous learning model) 2.​Technology a.​Configuration: -​ When you first start to use the mjn-SERAS, you will need to activate ‘training mode’. The sensors will begin to monitor the user’s brain activity and will start to create your personalized algorithm. During training mode, a minimum of 5 seizures must be recorded so that the algorithm can understand how your body, specifically your brain, responds to a seizure. Once the AI has processed the seizure data, your device is ready to use -​ Even if the alarm is false, the data is used to improve how the AI understands your unique requirements continuously. b.​Architecture: -​ mjn-SERAS uses 3 sensors to monitor brain activity which is sent via Bluetooth to the user’s mobile phone -​ The mobile app indicates three risk states: -​ Low risk – Minimum risk of seizure occurrence. -​ Medium risk – No significant risk of seizure. -​ High risk – Visual and acoustic warning signal alert.",What is the minimum number of seizures required for the mjn-SERAS device to start creating a personalized algorithm during its training mode?,en,The minimum number of seizures required for the mjn-SERAS device to start creating a personalized algorithm during its training mode is 5.,The minimum number of seizures required for the mjn-SERAS device to start creating a personalized algorithm is 5.
"Epilepsy alarms and monitors Introduction: Epilepsy alarms and monitors are devices designed to detect seizures and alert caregivers when a person is experiencing a seizure. There isn’t enough evidence yet to show that using a seizure alarm or monitor can guarantee someone’s safety during a seizure or prevent sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) that is why some people with epilepsy have found using alarms and monitors helpful as part of a risk reduction plan.​ ​ Most seizure alarms are designed to detect tonic-clonic seizures. These seizures are easier to detect because they involve movement. How to choose: -​ infos: Most of the alarms and monitors systems detect movement, but some detect sound, heart-rate, urination, getting out of bed and, more recently, brain activity. -​ Question to ask yourself: So fi you want to choose a system you must know what goal of detection you what by asking if you want: -​ Detection during specific period -​ Detection in or/and outside -​ Detection of the type of seizure Type of alarms and monitoring system: -​ Wearable seizure alarms and monitors -​ Apps and seizure alert subscription services paired with a device -​ Bed monitors -​ Seizure alarms with video monitoring How it works: Some devices respond to repeated shaking movements, which may indicate the person is having a seizure.This can be useful for detecting tonic-clonic seizures, as well as focal motor seizures (if there is enough movement involved). Case of common systems: -​ Wearable devices, such as smartwatches or bracelets, often use accelerometers to detect abnormal movements that are common during seizures. When the system detects abnormal motion, it sends a signal to his care providers team. For example, the Embrace2 is a wrist-worn wearable device that detects possible convulsive seizures and instantly alerts caregivers, whether they are nearby or far away. -​ Some devices utilize electrodermal activity (EDA) and photoplethysmography (PPG) to detect changes in skin conductance and blood flow, which can indicate a seizure. Machine learning algorithms can be applied to data from these sensors to improve detection accuracy. -​ Bed alarms and mattress devices are placed under the mattress and use motion sensors to detect unusual movements during sleep. These devices can alert caregivers if a seizure is detected. Some bed monitors trigger an alert when it senses repetitive muscle spasms like that of a tonic-clonic/grand mal seizure. -​ Seizure detection devices can also be non-wearable, such as camera devices that use infrared cameras to detect movements and trigger alarms when unusual movements are detected.","What factors should be considered when choosing an epilepsy alarm or monitor system, given that some systems detect movement, sound, heart-rate, urination, getting out of bed, and brain activity, and the goal of detection may vary based on specific periods, location, or other considerations?",en,"When choosing an epilepsy alarm or monitor system, several factors should be considered:

1. Type of Detection: Determine which type of seizure you want to detect - tonic-clonic, focal motor, or others. Some systems focus on movement, while others may detect sound, heart rate, urination, getting out of bed, and even brain activity.
2. Specific Periods: If you require detection during specific periods, such as at night, choose a system that can be set to activate only during those hours.
3. Location: Decide if you need detection in or outside your home, especially for those with active lifestyles who may require an alert even when away from home.
4. Goal of Detection: Understand what you aim to achieve by using an alarm or monitor system, whether it's part of a risk reduction plan or other objectives.
5. Type of System: Choose between wearable seizure alarms and monitors, apps and seizure alert subscription services paired with a device, bed monitors, or seizure alarms with video monitoring based on your specific needs and preferences.","Goals of detection, desired location for detection, type of seizure, and preferred device type (wearable, app, bed monitor, video) should be considered when choosing an epilepsy alarm or monitor system."

"what is a seizure:​ A seizure is a temporary event characterized by signs and symptoms resulting from abnormally excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. Types of Seizures Seizures are classified based on where they originate in the brain and their characteristics: 1.​ Generalized Seizures: ●​ Involve both hemispheres of the brain. ●​ Types include: ●​ Tonic-Clonic: Previously known as Grand Mal, involves muscle contraction followed by limb extension and shaking. ●​ Tonic: Sustained muscle contraction. ●​ Clonic: Shaking movements. ●​ Myoclonic: Muscle spasms. ●​ Absence: Brief loss of awareness, previously known as Petit Mal. ●​ Atonic: Loss of muscle activity 2.​ Focal Seizures: ●​ Originate in one hemisphere. ●​ Can be: ●​ Focal Aware: Previously known as simple partial, with retained awareness. ●​ Focal Impaired Awareness: Previously known as complex partial, with loss of awareness. ●​ Can involve motor symptoms (movement) or non-motor symptoms (sensory changes). 3.​ Focal to Bilateral Seizures: ●​ Start in one hemisphere and spread to both. Who Gets Seizures? Seizures can affect anyone, but certain conditions increase the risk: ●​ Vascular Causes: Stroke, hypertension. ●​ Infections: Meningitis, encephalitis. ●​ Toxins: Drugs, alcohol, medication overdoses. ●​ Structural Abnormalities: Arteriovenous malformations, tumors. ●​ Metabolic Causes: Hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances. ●​ Autoimmune Conditions: Vasculitis. ●​ Idiopathic: Unknown cause. ●​ Stress: Can trigger seizures in epileptic patients. Other Important Information ●​ Status Epilepticus: A seizure lasting over 5 minutes, requiring emergency treatment. ●​ Post-Ictal Phase: Period after a seizure characterized by confusion, tiredness, headaches, and sometimes psychosis or amnesia. ●​ Diagnosis: Involves witness accounts, physical exams, blood tests, and imaging (CT/MRI). Electroencephalograms (EEGs) may also be used. ●​ Management: Involves removing hazards, placing the individual in the recovery position, and administering medications like benzodiazepines. Follow-up care may include anti-seizure medication. link: Seizures - Seizure Types | Generalized vs Focal Seizures | Causes of Seizures (M…",What are the different types of seizures and how can they be distinguished from one another based on their characteristics and where they originate in the brain?,en,"The different types of seizures can be classified based on where they originate in the brain and their characteristics. Here are the main categories:

1. Generalized Seizures: These involve both hemispheres of the brain. The types include Tonic-Clonic (Grand Mal), Tonic, Clonic, Myoclonic, Absence (Petit Mal), and Atonic seizures.
   - Tonic-Clonic seizures (Grand Mal) involve muscle contraction followed by limb extension and shaking.
   - Tonic seizures are characterized by sustained muscle contraction.
   - Clonic seizures present as shaking movements.
   - Myoclonic seizures are muscle spasms.
   - Absence seizures (Petit Mal) involve a brief loss of awareness.
   - Atonic seizures are marked by a loss of muscle activity.

2. Focal Seizures: These originate in one hemisphere of the brain and can be further classified as:
   - Focal Aware (simple partial): With retained awareness, also previously known as simple partial seizures.
   - Focal Impaired Awareness (complex partial): With loss of awareness, also previously known as complex partial seizures. These seizures can involve motor symptoms (movement) or non-motor symptoms (sensory changes).

3. Focal to Bilateral Seizures: These start in one hemisphere and spread to both.

These different types of seizures can be distinguished from one another based on their characteristics, such as the location where they originate in the brain, whether there's loss of awareness or not, muscle contractions or spasms, and whether these affect only one side or both sides of the body. Additionally, understanding the underlying conditions that increase the risk of seizures can help with diagnosis.","Different types of seizures include Generalized (involving both hemispheres with various subtypes like Tonic-Clonic, Absence, etc.) and Focal (originating in one hemisphere, further divided into Focal Aware, Focal Impaired Awareness). Distinction lies in their characteristics and brain origin."
