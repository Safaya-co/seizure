"How effective is the use of deep learning algorithms, combined with multisensor recordings from wearable devices like wrist-worn and ankle-worn devices, for the automatic detection of various types of epileptic seizures, considering the results obtained across a spectrum of nine seizure types and data fusion techniques such as ACC and BVP?","The deep learning algorithms, combined with multisensor recordings from wearable devices, showed promising effectiveness in automatically detecting various epileptic seizures across nine types, with data fusion techniques like ACC and BVP performing well.","The use of deep learning algorithms combined with multisensor recordings from wearable devices like wrist-worn and ankle-worn devices has been found to be quite effective for the automatic detection of various types of epileptic seizures. This is based on the results obtained across a spectrum of nine seizure types, and data fusion techniques such as ACC (Accelerometer) and BVP (Blood Volume Pulse). The combination outperformed single data modality, with an overall Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) of .752 when applied to the complete dataset. Interestingly, machine learning models trained using all seizures regardless of their type performed better overall than models trained on specific seizure types.

"What type and specific role does the Empatica E4 device play in monitoring patients across two sites for their epilepsy clinical care, and why are there battery limitations associated with this device?","The Empatica E4 device monitors patients across two sites for epilepsy clinical care, recording 3-axis accelerometry, electrodermal activity, and photoplethysmography. Battery limitations are associated with this device due to the need for continuous recordings.","The Empatica E4 device plays a crucial role as a wearable device used for continuous monitoring of patients across two sites during their epilepsy clinical care. Specifically, it records three types of physiological signals: 3-axis accelerometry (ACC), electrodermal activity (EDA), and photoplethysmography (PPG). The PPG signal is processed on the device to a blood volume pulse signal. This data is used for analysis during seizures, with patients typically wearing the device on the arm most involved in motor semiology (movements) during these episodes.

The battery limitations associated with this device are likely due to the high sample rates at which it records these physiological signals: 32 Hz for accelerometry, 4 Hz for electrodermal activity, and 64 Hz for photoplethysmography. These high sampling frequencies require significant power, necessitating regular battery changes to ensure continuous recordings.","The Empatica E4 device is a research-grade wrist-worn wearable device that is used to monitor patients across two clinical sites, the University Medical Center Freiburg and the King's College Hospital London, for their epilepsy clinical care. The device is used to record biosignal data, specifically accelerometry (ACC), electrodermal activity (EDA), and blood volume pulse (BVP), in order to detect and analyze seizures. The device is worn on the non-dominant hand of the patient and is certified as a CE class IIa medical device.

However, there are battery limitations associated with the Empatica E4 device. Each participant is assigned two devices, which they change twice daily to ensure continuous recordings. The device has a battery life of up to 24 hours, depending on the quality of the battery and the recording mode. The device does not employ a data buffer and does not feature an automatic reconnect functionality, which can also impact battery life. Additionally, the device is rated as IP22 drip-resistant, meaning it can withstand some light water dripping vertically or at a slight angle on the device, but it should not be used in the shower or submerged in water."

"What is the primary difference between generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs), focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (FBTCSs), and focal seizures (FSs) in terms of their onset, progression, and hemispheric involvement?","GTCSs have a generalized onset, progress across both hemispheres, and may cause unconsciousness. FBTCSs start focally but become bilateral, while FSs originate locally and do not progress over both hemispheres.","The primary difference between generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs), focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (FBTCSs), and focal seizures (FSs) lies in their onset, progression, and hemispheric involvement. GTCSs and FBTCSs have a generalized onset across both hemispheres of the brain and may progress over both hemispheres during the seizure, while FSs originate from a localized area in one hemisphere and do not typically spread to the other hemisphere. Additionally, GTCSs and FBTCSs are often accompanied by a loss of awareness and impaired consciousness, whereas FSs can manifest with varying levels of awareness depending on their location within the brain.","GTCSs typically last no longer than 1 to 2 minutes, are accompanied by tachycardia, and are followed by a period of unconsciousness. They originate in both hemispheres of the brain and involve tonic (sustained muscle contraction) and clonic (shaking) movements that affect the entire body.

FBTCSs, on the other hand, start in one hemisphere and spread to both, often indistinguishable from GTCSs. They have a focal onset and typically progress to generalization during the tonic phase.

FSs have a localized onset in the brain and do not progress over both hemispheres. They are less well-known to the public and make up a considerable portion of seizures. FSs are much more varied in their manifestations than GTCSs, as symptoms can depend on the localization of the focus in the brain. Seizure classifications generally subdivide FSs by the awareness status of the patient and the occurrence of motor symptoms during the seizure. Older seizure classifications designated focal seizures without impairment of awareness as simple partial seizures, and those where the consciousness is impacted as complex partial seizures. However, those notations are not used anymore in current literature in favor of more verbose descriptions of the seizures. Any combination of awareness, motor, and non-motor manifestation can occur during the same seizure."

This multimodal approach helps to validate the results obtained from individual devices, reduces the risk of false negatives or false positives, and allows for the exploration of potential correlations between different types of data (e.g., heart rate variability, movement patterns, skin conductance). In summary, using multiple wearable devices in seizure detection research is crucial for improving the reliability, validity, and utility of the data collected for advancing our understanding and management of epilepsy.","The purpose of using multiple wearable devices in seizure detection research is to improve the accuracy and robustness of seizure detection.

"What are the two predominant factors that contribute to the widespread trend in non-EEG seizure detection studies of relying on small-scale, simulated, or synthetic datasets instead of using data from patients diagnosed with epilepsy?",The two predominant factors are: 1) New field with few established datasets; 2) Infrequent nature of epileptic seizures in making extensive recordings from multiple patients.,"Les deux facteurs principaux qui contribuent à la tendance largement répandue dans les études de détection non-EEG de crises épileptiques de reposer sur des ensembles de données restreints, simulés ou synthétiques plutôt que sur des données provenant de patients diagnostiqués avec l'épilepsie sont: 1) la relative nouvellezza del campo della ricerca in non-EEG detection, il quale non dispone ancora di dati pubblicamente disponibili, che sono più comuni nelle altre aree della ricerca sanitaria; 2) le crise epilettiche sono eventi infrequenti e rari, il che rende difficile la raccolta di un vasto insieme di dati di registrazione delle crisi generalizzate da più PWE (personne con l'epilessia).","The two predominant factors that contribute to the widespread trend in non-EEG seizure detection studies of relying on small-scale, simulated, or synthetic datasets instead of using data from patients diagnosed with epilepsy are:

1. Inaccessibility of datasets with high registration time: The datasets available for diagnosing epileptic seizures have a finite registration time (or recording), making it difficult to conduct serious (or important) research in the field of epileptic seizures. The complete datasets are not shared in the public domain, only a portion of the data may be available. Hence, real-time diagnosis of epileptic seizures is still challenging.

2. Lack of datasets from other neuroimaging modalities: Other neuroimaging modalities such as MRI are used for epileptic seizures detection. However, datasets with non-MRI modalities are not available, and this has led to limited research in this area. Therefore, providing datasets from other neuroimaging modalities is important to conduct research.

These factors make it difficult for researchers to access and use real-world, patient-derived data, leading to a reliance on small-scale, simulated, or synthetic datasets."
"What factors influence user acceptance and adherence to digital health technology systems, particularly in Parkinson's disease management, and how do demographic factors impact the acceptability of sharing such data, considering data privacy and security concerns associated with wearable devices?","Factors influencing user acceptance and adherence to digital health tech in Parkinson's management include comfort, discretion, and the burden of charging. Demographic factors like age, gender, education, employment status affect acceptability of sharing data, but privacy and security concerns pose challenges due to potential third-party access.","User acceptance and adherence to digital health technology systems, particularly in Parkinson's disease management, are influenced by factors such as comfort, discretion, and the burden of charging. In addition, these systems should be feasible and usable as demonstrated by high adherence rates among participants in a study on mobility monitoring and medication adherence.

Demographic factors, including gender, age, education, and employment status, can impact the acceptability of sharing digital health data associated with smart devices. It's important to have an in-depth understanding of these demographic factors for optimizing the design of research studies and clinical trials employing such devices.

With regards to data privacy and security concerns, wearable devices collect and store personal health data like heart rate, activity levels, and sleep patterns typically in the cloud. There are rising concerns about third-party access to this data without explicit consent from users, thus posing privacy and security issues. Existing regulatory frameworks such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) offer some protection for personal health data, but there is a pressing need for more robust regulations to address these concerns effectively.","User acceptance and adherence to digital health technology systems, particularly in Parkinson's disease management, are influenced by several factors. These include comfort, discretion, and the burden of charging. High adherence rates have been observed in studies involving digital health technology systems designed for monitoring mobility and evaluating medication adherence, demonstrating the feasibility and usability of such systems [39].

Demographic factors, such as gender, age, education, and employment status, are intertwined with the ownership of smart devices and influence the acceptability of sharing digital health data [40]. An in-depth understanding of these factors is essential for optimizing the design of research studies and clinical trials employing smart devices.

Data privacy and security concerns are significant issues associated with wearable devices, which are pivotal in tracking and monitoring personal health data, including heart rate, activity levels, and sleep patterns. The collected information is typically stored in the cloud, raising concerns about third-party access to this data and potential privacy and security issues [41,42]. Existing regulatory frameworks, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), offer some protection for personal health data. However, a more robust regulatory framework and industry self-regulation are necessary to ensure the appropriate use and safeguarding of this sensitive information [41,42].

Privacy breaches and data misuse have been documented, highlighting the importance of informed consent and user autonomy in data collection and usage. High-profile cases, such as Strava inadvertently disclosing sensitive locations and Fitbit facing legal action for selling personal health data, underscore the risks associated with inadequate privacy measures [41,42]. Maintaining user awareness and obtaining explicit consent for data sharing are crucial components in preserving privacy and mitigating potential misuse of personal health information [42].

Implementing robust data security measures, including encryption protocols and access controls, is essential for safeguarding sensitive health data stored by wearable devices. These security measures can help mitigate the risks of data breaches and unauthorized access, thus bolstering user trust and confidence in wearable technology [42]."
"What is the summary of the research focusing on seizure detection using wearables, including an overview of relevant biosignal sensor modalities, examples of ACC signals during seizures, tonic-clonic seizure detection performance in related work, and discussion about in-hospital recording setup?","The research focuses on seizure detection using wearables, with an overview of Accelerometer (ACC), Heart Rate Variability (BVP), and Electrodermal Activity (EDA) as relevant biosignal sensor modalities. Examples of ACC signals during seizures are provided, along with tonic-clonic seizure detection performance in related work. The research also discusses an in-hospital recording setup.","The research discussed focuses on seizure detection using wearable devices. The study provides an overview of relevant biosignal sensor modalities such as Accelerometer (ACC), Blood Volume Pulse (BVP), and others. Examples of ACC signals during seizures are presented, demonstrating changes in movement patterns that can indicate a seizure. The tonic-clonic seizure detection performance in related work is discussed, with an emphasis on the accuracy and reliability of these wearables in detecting seizures. Lastly, there's a discussion about the in-hospital recording setup, which involves the use of specialized equipment to record various biosignals during a patient's stay at the hospital. This information is crucial for understanding the potential of wearable technology in improving the early detection and management of seizures.","The research focuses on seizure detection using wearables, specifically for epileptic motor seizures. An extensive data set of biosignal data from wearables was collected in a cohort of patients with epilepsy, including recorded epileptic seizures with expert-labelled seizure onset and offset. The research topics presented in this thesis can be summarized to several key contributions, including the dissemination of study design and procedure experiences, the implementation and setup of a local data collection architecture, and the resolution of several data issues like timestamp synchronization. A novel methodology was developed for the automated detection of convulsive tonic-clonic seizures (TCSs) using features from ACC and EDA biosignals with an ensemble supervised machine learning model. This technique could correctly classify 91% of the seizure events in an out-of-sample test set and has a false alarm rate comparable to other TCS detection methodologies employing multimodal non-EEG wearables. A heuristic ACC-based detector of cessation of movement after convulsive seizures was also developed, which could correctly classify 100% of the post-ictal events in study participants. These contributions show that monitoring convulsive epileptic seizures with multimodal wearable devices is feasible with high robustness. The research also explores the detection of focal seizures, which is more ambiguous due to the variety of motor manifestations and the impact on biosignals. Patient-specific detection models perform better than those evaluated within entire cohorts, indicating a substantial need for the automated detection of focal seizures from wearables."
What are the recent studies on wearable multimodal seizure detectors and their potential for improving non-invasive seizure detection?,"Recent studies like [19] Onorati, [21] Nasseri, and [22] Nielsen are developing wearable multimodal seizure detectors for improved non-invasive seizure detection. These devices use various techniques such as machine learning networks ([21]) and multicenter clinical assessments ([19]).","The recent studies on wearable multimodal seizure detectors can be found in references [19], [21], [23] and [24].

Reference [19] by Onorati et al. presents a multicenter clinical assessment of improved wearable multimodal convulsive seizure detectors, published in Epilepsia in 2017.

In reference [21], Nasseri et al. discuss non-invasive wearable seizure detection using long–short-term memory networks with transfer learning, which was published in the Journal of Neural Engineering in April 2021.

Reference [23] by Van de Velet al., reviews and updates the state of art of non-EEG seizure detection systems and their potential for SUDEP prevention, as published in Seizure in 2016.

Finally, reference [24] by Friedman and Kazl provides an overview of seizure detection and its role in SUDEP prevention in Practical Neurology, published in November 2018. These studies suggest that wearable multimodal seizure detectors have the potential to significantly improve non-invasive seizure detection, contributing to better management and care for patients with epilepsy.","Based on the information provided, there are recent studies on wearable multimodal seizure detectors that have shown promising results for improving non-invasive seizure detection. A study by Onorati et al. (2017) conducted a multicenter clinical assessment of improved wearable multimodal convulsive seizure detectors and found that the system was able to detect seizures with a sensitivity of 90% and a false alarm rate of 0.20 per 24 hours. Another study by Nielsen et al. (2023) conducted an out-of-hospital multimodal seizure detection pilot study and found that the system was able to detect seizures with a sensitivity of 96% and a false alarm rate of 0.03 per night. These studies suggest that wearable multimodal seizure detectors have the potential to improve non-invasive seizure detection and could be useful for monitoring patients with epilepsy in real-world settings. However, further research is needed to validate these findings and to assess the performance of these devices in larger and more diverse populations."
"What modifications would be necessary to make an automatic seizure detection system effective as a precursor for a Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) warning system, given that the current detection methodology has a significant delay due to its choice of features from multimodal biosignal data and a long-term feature calculation window?","A shorter detection delay is needed for the seizure detector, ideally a few seconds. This could be achieved by using features with less computation time and reducing the long-term feature calculation window.","To make an automatic seizure detection system effective as a precursor for a Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) warning system, the following modifications would be necessary:

1. Reducing the detection delay: Since the current methodology has a significant delay due to its choice of features from multimodal biosignal data, it is essential to reduce this delay to make the system useful for a SUDEP warning system. The ideal detection delay should be a few seconds at most.

2. Revising the feature calculation window: The long-term feature calculation window (e.g., 5 minutes into the future) should be revised to minimize the delay in seizure detection. This might require finding features that provide meaningful representations of the seizure without requiring such a long duration for accurate detection.

3. Investigating alternative or complementary detection methods: Some related studies have reported detection latencies, suggesting that alternative or complementary methodologies with shorter latencies could be explored to improve the accuracy and timeliness of seizure detection. For instance, studies based on electrocardiography (ECG) data or other modalities might offer reduced latency without compromising accuracy.

4. Validating the new methodology: Once modifications have been made, it is crucial to validate the new seizure detection methodology in terms of its accuracy, delay, and effectiveness as a precursor for a SUDEP warning system. This validation should ideally be done through experiments or simulations using real-world data from epilepsy patients.","To make an automatic seizure detection system effective as a precursor for a Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) warning system, the following modifications would be necessary:

1. Reduce detection delay: The current system has a significant delay due to its choice of features from multimodal biosignal data and a long-term feature calculation window. To reduce this delay, the EDA features would need to be changed, specifically the long window duration. This would likely involve taking into account only the quick response to a peak value and not the slow minute-long decline back to a baseline. A lower-latency detection system seems to be within the realm of possibilities, but was not part of the research included in this thesis.
2. Real-time system: The system would need to be able to recognize a seizure in real-time, or with a detection delay of at most a few seconds, to be useful as a SUDEP warning system.
3. Consider other biosignal modalities: Other biosignal modalities, such as photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, could be used to estimate heart rate (HR) and other cardiac features. However, these sensors are very susceptible to motion artifacts.
4. Monitor post-ictal immobility: The detection of post-ictal immobility, a state of unconsciousness and no movement that often occurs after patients have had a convulsive seizure, could be used to foreshadow sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). A simple heuristic approach based on ACC data can robustly detect this period in a data set of convulsive seizures recorded in the hospital. This detection of post-ictal immobility is specifically dependent on prior knowledge of a seizure, and thus would need to be joined with an automatic seizure detection in order to be used in a real-world alarm system for heightened susceptibility to SUDEP.
5. Model personalization: Model personalization could be implemented to improve the performance of the seizure detection system, especially for motor focal seizures (FSs) and non-motor FSs, which are possibly the hardest to detect with wearables. This would likely involve using different types of biosignals or features thereof.
6. Data sharing and crowdsourcing: To predict seizures before they happen, or"
What is the aim of this research and how does it propose to address the limitations of current methods for long-term seizure monitoring in epilepsy patients?,"The aim of this research is to develop an alternative for ultra-long-term seizure monitoring using multimodal data from wearable devices, addressing the limitations of current methods in epilepsy patients' daily lives.","The aim of this research is to investigate the potential use of multimodal non-electroencephalography data recorded from wearable devices as a tool for seizure detection. This is aimed at addressing the limitations of current methods for long-term seizure monitoring in epilepsy patients, which are not viable during daily lives and over extended periods, and which often rely on unreliable handwritten diaries that undercount the number of seizures occurring. The research proposes to use a new dataset of wearable biosignal data recorded at two European epilepsy centers in the context of a collaborative research project. This dataset includes data from over 200 patients with epilepsy and over 300 epileptic seizures of varying types, as recorded using the Empatica E4, a research-grade wrist-worn wearable device that captures biosignal modalities such as accelerometry (movement), electrodermal activity (electrical skin conductance), and blood volume pulse (optical pulse). The research further explores the potential application of seizure detection in the context of an automatic alarm system.","The aim of this research is to address the scarcity of resources in the field of non-electroencephalography (EEG) seizure detection by establishing the Open Seizure Database (OSDB) as the first openly accessible database encompassing non-EEG sensor data from multiple sensing modalities. This study utilizes real-world data, providing an accurate depiction of everyday life compared to controlled EMU-based datasets. The OSDB includes data from 494 events collected over 453 days, with each event labeled and optimized for machine/deep learning. Among these events, 146 epileptic seizures were recorded, including 50 generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures, 47 other seizures, 27 aura/focal, and 22 atonic/falls. The cumulative duration of recorded epileptic events amounts to 5 hours, 51 minutes, making it the most extensive publicly available cohort of non-EEG seizure data to date. Additionally, 302 common human movements that triggered false alarms during the data collection period were recorded and labeled. The inclusion of labelled false alarms in the dataset offers a valuable resource to address the challenge of false positives in non-EEG seizure detection.

The research proposes to address the limitations of current methods for long-term seizure monitoring in epilepsy patients by providing a diverse, multimodal dataset for researchers to explore and develop new seizure detection techniques. The OSDB's extensive data on epileptic seizures and labelled false alarms presents a unique opportunity to advance the field and potentially establish a non-EEG gold standard for seizure detection. With continued data collection and exploration of novel techniques, the OSDB and Open Seizure TestKit (OSTK) aim to improve seizure detection techniques and make a positive impact on the lives of those affected by epilepsy."
"What is the primary challenge faced by epilepsy patients during long-term EEG monitoring for seizure detection, and are there alternative methods of seizure monitoring in an outpatient context?",The primary challenge is wearing high-density EEG electrode arrays or having electrodes implanted. An alternative method is keeping a seizure diary.,"The primary challenge faced by epilepsy patients during long-term EEG monitoring for seizure detection is the need to wear high-density EEG electrode arrays or have electrodes implanted, which can be inconvenient and may affect their daily activities. An alternative method of seizure monitoring in an outpatient context is keeping a seizure diary of manually recorded occurrences of seizures in the patient's daily life. This systematic and long-term documentation is essential for therapeutic decision-making and clinical and pharmacological studies.","The primary challenge faced by epilepsy patients during long-term EEG monitoring for seizure detection is the discomfort and impracticality of having electrodes placed on the scalp. Additionally, long-term EEG monitoring can be time-consuming, costly, and may require trained professionals for setup and interpretation.

As an alternative, non-electroencephalogram-based seizure detection devices have several advantages over traditional EEG-based methods. These devices can be more comfortable and user-friendly, as they often come in the form of wearables such as smartwatches, sensors, or even smartphone-based detection methods. They are also less expensive, more accessible, and can provide continuous seizure detection at home, which can improve long-term care and reduce the emotional burden of frequent hospital visits.

In an outpatient context, wearable biosensors are emerging as potential alternatives for continuous EEG recording. These devices provide a balance between signal quality and user acceptability. One subscalp system, the 24/7 EEGTM SubQ, has been CE-marked for epilepsy monitoring and diagnosis, following a trial demonstrating its safety and feasibility. Automatically assisted, visual identification of electrographic seizures has also been demonstrated in the ultra-long-term setting with this system.

Non-invasive wearable biosensors, such as those measuring photoplethysmography (PPG), electromyography (EMG), accelerometry, EEG, electrocardiography (EKG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and skin temperature, are also available. These sensors can track sleep, exercise rates, stress, and other factors that may trigger seizure onset. Currently, there are two FDA and EU-approved wearable sensors for detecting convulsive seizures, and other CE-Marked devices are available, with studies of performance at detecting seizures ongoing.

While most commercially available sensors do not have regulatory approval for use in epilepsy, these non-EEG-based seizure detection devices show promise in providing a more comfortable and accessible method of seizure monitoring for epilepsy patients in an outpatient context."
