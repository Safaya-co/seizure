"How effective is the use of deep learning algorithms, combined with multisensor recordings from wearable devices like wrist-worn and ankle-worn devices, for the automatic detection of various types of epileptic seizures, considering the results obtained across a spectrum of nine seizure types and data fusion techniques such as ACC and BVP?","The deep learning algorithms, combined with multisensor recordings from wearable devices, showed promising effectiveness in automatically detecting various epileptic seizures across nine types, with data fusion techniques like ACC and BVP performing well.","The use of deep learning algorithms combined with multisensor recordings from wearable devices like wrist-worn and ankle-worn devices has been found to be quite effective for the automatic detection of various types of epileptic seizures. This is based on the results obtained across a spectrum of nine seizure types, and data fusion techniques such as ACC (Accelerometer) and BVP (Blood Volume Pulse). The combination outperformed single data modality, with an overall Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) of .752 when applied to the complete dataset. Interestingly, machine learning models trained using all seizures regardless of their type performed better overall than models trained on specific seizure types. This suggests that automatic epileptic seizure detection using machine learning and wearable device data is feasible across a broad spectrum of motor and nonmotor seizures.","The use of deep learning algorithms, combined with multisensor recordings from wearable devices like wrist-worn and ankle-worn devices, has shown to be effective for the automatic detection of various types of epileptic seizures.

We collected demo- graphic data, clinical patient data, and seizure characteristics. Epileptic seizure semiology and etiology were classified ac- cording to the International League Against Epilepsy crite- ria,27 and patients with a high hourly frequency of seizures or clusters of four or more seizures in 15-\xadmin time windows were excluded. 2.2 | Seizure data collection This study utilized the conventional 10–\xad20 electrode scalp EEG system during video-\xadEEG monitoring.28 Video-\xadEEG review by a board-\xadcertified clinical epileptologist confirmed electrographic seizure onset and offset annotations as well as semiology of seizure types. 2.3 | Synchronization of EEG and wearable device clocks The wearable device and EEG monitor record with independ- ent clocks. To compensate for the time drift between the de- vice and EEG clocks, we synchronized the device clocks at the start of the device recording. After we turned on the re- cording device, we simultaneously pressed the device button and EEG event marker button. This created a time tag on both the device and EEG recordings. When we placed two weara- ble devices on the patient, the button press was done simulta- neously for both. We recorded a video of the syncing process and used video timestamps to verify device placement times in cases where we could not find EEG event markers due to button press failures. When patients agreed to wear the recording device again on a second day or in another admis- sion, they were enrolled again, and the process was repeated. We defined the start timing error between the wristband and EEG clock as the time difference between the wristband and EEG clock at the beginning of the experiment (Figure S1b). Figure 1A shows the distribution of start timing errors observed in our study; absolute errors follow approximately a Gaussian distribution and are predominantly shorter than 20 s. The wearable devices also have button press failures, which are indicated by a large start timing error. We set the start timing error to 0 when there is a button press failure. To ensure the seizure segment is within the annotation, we added 20-\xads preseizure and 20-\xads postseizure end windows. Figure 1B shows the timing drift of the Empatica E4 for 11 different devices at different time points, confirming device-\xad agnostic frequency stability of 1 ppm12 and a constant timing drift of 13 s in 24 h. These observations allowed us to derive the following three-\xadstep timing error compensation scheme: (1) 13-\xads offline timing drift compensation was added to the signal data; (2) the start timing error was calculated (Figure S1b), and labels were adjusted accordingly; and (3) 20-\xads pre- seizure and 20-\xads postseizure end windows were added. In a final step, we added verified seizure annotations to the signal data. 2.4 | Data quality check We downloaded EEGs and wearable sensor device data sepa- rately and manually labeled each dataset. Subsequently, we reviewed data for possible missing or incorrect annotations, recording failures, or missing data by running seizure an- notations and wearable sensor device data through custom-\xad developed quality check processes (Figure S2). Patients occasionally removed wristbands. In this study, we used TEMP sensor data to detect whether the wristband had been removed. We used a 10-\xadmin moving average to smoothen the TEMP recordings. For temperature values higher than 45° or lower than 27°, we added 10-\xadmin safety windows to both ends of the segment, and we excluded this time window from the study. 2.5 | Data analysis 2.5.1 | ML techniques We used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify raw time series data and applied random undersampling to balance the raw data. We first trained different detection models separately on individual ACC, EDA, and BVP data. Then we serially trialed different combinations of sensor mo- dalities, including ACC and EDA, ACC and BVP, EDA and BVP, and ACC, BVP, and EDA. The entire ML framework and the architectures and functionalities of the developed CNN models are shown in Figure 2. Our CNN model consists of two convolutional layers. Convolutional Layer 1 is followed by Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and dropout operations. Convolutional Layer 2 is fol- lowed by ReLU and max pooling. The final layer is a global average pooling29 layer. The network outputs are probabilis- tic distributions related to the target classes. In Poh et al.,30 data reduction and support vector machines (SVMs) were used to detect secondarily generalized tonic–\xad clonic seizures with 94% sensitivity and a .74/24-\xadh false alarm rate (FAR).

We applied EDA shifting for 120 s to all fusions of sensor modalities. 4 | DISCUSSION 4.1 | Summary In our study, we used a seizure-\xadlevel evaluation for seizure detection and found that fusing ACC and BVP data modali- ties achieved the best AUC-\xadROC of .752 applied to all sei- zure samples lumped together across all seizure types when we trained one generalized model with all seizure types. Results show the feasibility of seizure detection across a broad spectrum of seizure types, including but not limited to GTCSs, with wrist-\xadworn wearable sensors in a large cohort of patients. Our study expands current literature by demon- strating that noninvasive, wrist-\xad and ankle-\xadworn sensors and custom-\xaddeveloped deep learning techniques can automati- cally detect a variety of epileptic seizure types. Numerous previous studies have shown the feasibility of using ML and, in particular, deep learning models to auto- matically detect,24 classify,25 and predict5,32 epileptic seizure episodes in EEG signals. Initial studies using electrodes im- planted in the brain have increasingly been followed with less intrusive systems measuring scalp EEG data.33 The advent of commercially available medical-\xadgrade wearable sensors and mobile smart devices, such as smartwatches, provided an opportunity to assess the suitability of other data modal- ities for seizure detection.8 Some of these explorations have shown promise for detecting GTCSs,23,26,31,34 and based thereon smartwatches have first received US Food and Drug Administration approval and medical clearance for use as ep- ilepsy monitoring devices.35,36 4.2 | Performance comparison for GTCSs We compared a previously utilized detection method30 with a CNN to detect GTCSs. In the previous study, the authors ex- tracted 19 features from ACC and EDA, then applied SVM, and reached an AUC-\xadROC of .896, a sensitivity of 73%, and a FAR of 12.52/24 h. Our CNN reached an AUC-\xadROC of .957, a sensitivity of 80%, and a FAR of 13.63/24 h. The CNN performed better than Poh et al. 's method, as shown by the 5.9% higher AUC-\xadROC value. However, the perfor- mance of the CNN is lower than the SVM reported in the mentioned study30 (94% sensitivity and .74/24h FAR). One main reason could be that our dataset contains mainly chil- dren, a cohort that tends to exhibit pronounced movement activity during seizure-\xadfree times. Additionally, the study reported a median electrographic latency of 42.95 s. In our study, the average latency is 51.67 s. Onorati et al.26 included 55 convulsive epileptic seizures (six focal tonic–\xadclonic sei- zures and 49 FBTCSs) from 22 patients and achieved 83.6% sensitivity and .29/24h FAR. Their study26 included 24 chil- dren and 45 adults, with an age range of 4–\xad18 and 19–\xad60 years, respectively, including patients who did not experi- ence seizures during the experiment. In comparison, our patients are children, with only three patients older than 20 years. Once monitoring data from children and adolescents are included in a dataset, seizure detection may become more challenging. The algorithm in Onorati et al.26 failed to detect all three seizures of a 4-\xadyear-\xadold child. 4.3 | Effect of detection modality We expected that models trained on specific seizure types would perform better than models trained on the combined TABLE 3 10-\xadfold cross-\xadvalidation performance Seizure type ACC EDA BVP ACC + BVP ACC + EDA BVP + EDA ACC + EDA + BVP Focal to bilateral tonic–\xadclonic .919 .662 .886 .910 .905 .862 .890 Focal tonic .812 .624 .736 .772 .789 .719 .758 Focal subclinical .555 .429 .642 .623 .520 .603 .568 Focal automatisms .541 .699 .811 .761 .772 .807 .780 Focal behavior arrest .765 .532 .693 .713 .730 .593 .737 Focal clonic .564 .588 .830 .762 .593 .758 .668 Generalized epileptic spasms .840 .450 .711 .831 .796 .632 .789 Generalized tonic .662 .565 .779 .746 .698 .661 .704 Generalized tonic–\xadclonic .995 .802 .889 .992 .987 .939 .990 All nine seizure types .720 .549 .744 .752 .695 .672 .705 Note: 10-\xadfold cross-\xadvalidation performance of detection models trained on individual modality data (Columns 1–\xad3) and multimodality data fusion (Columns 4–\xad7).

"What is the purpose and significance of the Open Seizure Database and Toolkit introduced in this research paper, and what unique contribution does it make to the field of non-electroencephalogram seizure detection research?","The Open Seizure Database and Toolkit aim to advance non-EEG seizure detection research. They offer a unique, open-access database containing multimodal sensor data from real-world environments, providing the most extensive publicly available non-EEG seizure data to date. This includes 146 epileptic seizures and 348 labelled false alarms. The Toolkit facilitates machine/deep learning for rapid model development and deployment.","The purpose of the Open Seizure Database and Toolkit, as introduced in this research paper, is to serve as a publicly accessible resource aimed at advancing research into non-electroencephalogram (non-EEG) seizure detection. This unique contribution lies in its extensive multimodal sensor data from 49 participants in real-world, in-home environments, making it the first openly accessible database of its kind. The Open Seizure Database contains 494 events, including 146 epileptic seizures over a duration of 453 days, which represents the most extensive publicly available non-EEG seizure data to date. Furthermore, it includes 348 labelled false alarms, such as common human movements and activities, to aid in the development and training of seizure detection models using machine and deep learning practices. The Open Seizure Toolkit is designed to facilitate this process by streamlining data from the Open Seizure Database for rapid development, training, and deployment of seizure detection models on the Open Seizure Detector Android app.","The Open Seizure Database and Toolkit (OSDB and OSTK) are novel contributions to the field of non-electroencephalogram (non-EEG) seizure detection research. The OSDB is the first publicly accessible database containing non-EEG epileptic seizure recordings from real-world, in-home environments. This database addresses the scarcity of resources in the non-EEG domain and provides a valuable resource for researchers to advance non-EEG seizure detection. The OSTK, on the other hand, is designed to facilitate machine and deep learning practices by streamlining data from the OSDB. This toolkit allows researchers to rapidly develop and train seizure detection models before deploying them to the Open Seizure Detector Android application.

The OSDB contains multimodal sensor data from 49 participants in real-world, in-home environments, comprised of 494 events, encompassing 146 epileptic seizures, collected over a duration of 453 days. This makes it the most extensive publicly available non-electroencephalogram seizure data to date. Additionally, the database has 348 labelled false alarms, including 302 common human movements and activities. The inclusion of labelled false alarms in the dataset offers a valuable resource to address the challenge of false positives in non-EEG seizure detection.

The unique contribution of this research is the establishment of the OSDB, which provides a real-world data set that can help researchers explore diverse multimodal approaches for seizure detection. The extensive data on epileptic seizures and labelled false alarms presents a unique opportunity to advance the field. With continued data collection and exploration of novel techniques, the OSDB and OSTK have the promise of establishing a non-EEG gold standard and ultimately improving seizure detection techniques.

INTRODUCTION Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that affects an estimated 65 million people worldwide, characterised by recurring unprovoked seizures due to an abnormal, hypersynchronous discharge between communicating neurons [1]. Epidemiological studies suggest that approximately 30% of patients with epilepsy (PWE) are refractory to common therapeutic treatments, which increases the risk of a sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). SUDEP is the leading cause of premature death observed in patients diagnosed with refractory epilepsy and is defined as a death in epilepsy that is not attributable to trauma, drowning or status epilepticus [2]. Although the underlying etiology behind SUDEP remains un- known, studies show that in 67% of cases, there were indications of a generalised seizure preceding the terminal event [3] [4]. Additionally, there is evidence to indicate that seizure-induced perturbations in respiratory, cardiac, and electrocerebral functions, along with several potential predisposing risk factors, could contribute to SUDEP [5]. Lamberts et al found that 58% of SUDEP cases were associated with sleep, and that 86% of instances occurred when the PWE was alone and unsupervised [6]. Sveinsson et al’s analysis of 321 SUDEP cases yielded similar findings, with most instances occurring at night in the patient’s home whilst living alone (71%) [6]. While similar J.

These findings indicate that such factors significantly increase the likelihood of SUDEP, with studies concluding that up to 69% of cases could have been prevented if patients were not left unattended at night. Despite an increase in clinical studies, little progress has been made in characterising SUDEP risk factors and the underlying mechanisms leading to premature death in epilepsy [7] [8]. This has led numerous studies to postulate that seizure detection could serve as a means to deter terminal seizures pre-ictal, and reduce the incidence of SUDEP cases through early intervention and prevention.

RELATED WORK The electroencephalogram (EEG) represents the diagnostic gold standard modality for capturing seizures within hospital settings, employing continuous electrical brain wave monitoring over an extended period. However, the EEG’s utility as an assistive diagnostic tool is unsuitable outside of a hospital or epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) due to the need for a PWE to remain in a stationary position with multiple scalp-based electrodes attached, and a full- time neurodiagnostic technician to interpret real-time neurological activity. To overcome the limitations associated with EEG, a new sub-field of research has emerged known as non-EEG detection. This approach utilises non-invasive methods to detect seizures in real-world environments. These methods include wearable devices that measure physiological signals such as heart rate, movement and electrodermal activity. The accelerometer (ACM) has emerged as the most promising non-EEG sensing modality, having been extensively explored in non-EEG research for capturing changes in motion and velocity displayed by PWE.']","Posted on 16 Aug 2020 — CC-BY 4.0 — https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.23957625.v1 — e-Prints posted on TechRxiv are preliminary reports that are not peer reviewed.

"What type and specific role does the Empatica E4 device play in monitoring patients across two sites for their epilepsy clinical care, and why are there battery limitations associated with this device?","The Empatica E4 device monitors patients across two sites for epilepsy clinical care, recording 3-axis accelerometry, electrodermal activity, and photoplethysmography. Battery limitations are associated with this device due to the need for continuous recordings.","The Empatica E4 device plays a crucial role as a wearable device used for continuous monitoring of patients across two sites during their epilepsy clinical care. Specifically, it records three types of physiological signals: 3-axis accelerometry (ACC), electrodermal activity (EDA), and photoplethysmography (PPG). The PPG signal is processed on the device to a blood volume pulse signal. This data is used for analysis during seizures, with patients typically wearing the device on the arm most involved in motor semiology (movements) during these episodes.

The battery limitations associated with this device are likely due to the high sample rates at which it records these physiological signals: 32 Hz for accelerometry, 4 Hz for electrodermal activity, and 64 Hz for photoplethysmography. These high sampling frequencies require significant power, necessitating regular battery changes to ensure continuous recordings.","The Empatica E4 device is a research-grade wrist-worn wearable device that is used to monitor patients across two clinical sites, the University Medical Center Freiburg and the King's College Hospital London, for their epilepsy clinical care. The device is used to record biosignal data, specifically accelerometry (ACC), electrodermal activity (EDA), and blood volume pulse (BVP), in order to detect and analyze seizures. The device is worn on the non-dominant hand of the patient and is certified as a CE class IIa medical device.

However, there are battery limitations associated with the Empatica E4 device. Each participant is assigned two devices, which they change twice daily to ensure continuous recordings. The device has a battery life of up to 24 hours, depending on the quality of the battery and the recording mode. The device does not employ a data buffer and does not feature an automatic reconnect functionality, which can also impact battery life. Additionally, the device is rated as IP22 drip-resistant, meaning it can withstand some light water dripping vertically or at a slight angle on the device, but it should not be used in the shower or submerged in water.",0.8404225707054138,0.9068033695220948,0.8723519444465637,"['Consecutive patients were admitted to their respective EMU as part of their standard epilepsy clinical care, for differential diagnosis or for presurgical evaluation, and may have had their antiepileptic medication reduced during the recording. All patients were continuously moni- tored via a video-electroencephalography (vEEG) system during their stay in the EMU. Clinical experts manually reviewed the video and EEG data for all participants and labeled type, onset, and offset for all seizures. Specifically, they also labeled the onset and termination of every motor manifestation, including the tonic and clonic phases of each seizure. These labels were then used as the ground truth in the training and testing phases of the evaluation. Participants wore a variety of different wearable devices across the 2 sites. However, the only device worn by participants from both sites was the Empatica E4 (Section 3.2.1; Empatica Inc., Boston, MA, USA). Owing to battery limitations, each participant was assigned 2 devices, between which they changed twice daily to ensure continuous recordings. The wearable de- vice recorded 3-axis accelerometry (ACC) at a sample rate of 32 Hz, electrodermal activity (EDA) at 4 Hz, and photoplethysmography (PPG) at 64 Hz, which was processed on the device to a blood volume pulse signal. Participants generally wore the device on the arm that was most involved in motor semiology during seizures, that is, the arm that presented the most substantial movements. In the set of 10 participants with TCSs included here, each wore the device on their non-dominant hand, except for 2 participants included in this study who spec- ified that they were ambidextrous. The study and recording procedures are further described in Chapter 3. All recruited patients provided written informed consent, and the study procedures were approved by the ethics committee at the University of Freiburg (538/16) and the London Ful- ham Research Ethics Committee (16/LO/2209; Integrated Research Application System project ID216316). 4.1. DETECTION OF TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURES 67 Features An extensive feature set was created from the ACC and EDA signals, encompassing 141 ACC and 10 EDA features, at sliding window sizes of 2, 10, and 20 seconds for the ACC features, and 5, 10, and 20 minutes for the EDA features. PPG signals were not analyzed in this study because of major ictal movement artifacts resulting from the convulsive TCSs. Although ar- tifacts in PPG data can still convey information, in that the presence of noise itself can be information, the choice was made to omit it here in favor of focusing on the other 2 biosig- nals, because the information of PPG motion artifacts is naturally included in the ACC signal as well. The ACC features included a variety of different time and frequency domain features. The EDA features represented the skin conductance level (SCL), that is, tonic low-frequency EDA changes, and skin conductance response rate (SCRR), that is, phasic or higher-frequency EDA changes, calculated against a baseline. As detection models usually perform most effectively with smaller feature sets, both in terms of computational cost and prediction performance [307], the number of used features was reduced considerably. For this feature selection, related literature in the field of wearable seizure detection was consulted to narrow down window sizes that effectively capture rele- vant signal changes in time and identify feature types that were successfully used previously. Thereby, a window of 10 seconds for the ACC features was selected [214, 215, 224], and a longer window of 5 minutes for the EDA features to capture the tonic changes in the EDA signal that evolve over longer periods [153]. The feature data were then visualized in a period around the seizure, overlaid over each other, and for all features separately. In addition, the mean and standard deviation (SD) for each data series was plotted. The data that were used for these graphs were taken only from the seizures of participants that were not included in the test set to be used in the out-of-sample performance evaluation (see Section 4.1.3). Fea- tures showing recurrent typical ictal changes were then visually selected for further analysis (Figure 4.1). Variable seizure durations were handled by upsampling shorter seizures by linear interpolation to the length of the longest seizure among those plotted. The resulting feature subset for the ACC modality consisted of the magnitude, zero cross- ing rate, and recurrence plot features (Figure 4.1) [308]. For the EDA features, the area under the curve and the maximum of the SCL within the window, and the SCRR were chosen, all corrected against a baseline, which is an interval of the same duration as the feature window, ending immediately before the beginning of the feature window. Thus, the resulting feature set can be divided into 4 main feature groups: 1. Magnitude of the ACC signal (ACC = p x2 + y2 + z2): (a) Raw ACC signal, over a 10 s window. (b) Band pass filtered ACC signal over a 10 s window. The band pass filter had a fre- quency band of 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz, representing the linear component of the ACC signal, and was applied before segmentation into windows. (c) Low-pass filtered ACC signal over a 10 s window. The low-pass filter had a cutoff frequency of 1 Hz, thus preserving only the gravitational component of the ACC signal, and was applied before segmentation into windows. 2. Zero crossing rate of the ACC signal over a 10 s window, for each of the 3 axes, respec- tively. The zero crossing rate is the number of times in a certain period the signal crosses the value 0 over the same period. 68 CHAPTER 4.']","Consecutive patients were admitted to their respective EMU as part of their standard epilepsy clinical care, for differential diagnosis or for presurgical evaluation, and may have had their antiepileptic medication reduced during the recording.

FBTCSs start focally but become bilateral, while FSs originate locally and do not progress over both hemispheres.","The primary difference between generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs), focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (FBTCSs), and focal seizures (FSs) lies in their onset, progression, and hemispheric involvement. GTCSs and FBTCSs have a generalized onset across both hemispheres of the brain and may progress over both hemispheres during the seizure, while FSs originate from a localized area in one hemisphere and do not typically spread to the other hemisphere. Additionally, GTCSs and FBTCSs are often accompanied by a loss of awareness and impaired consciousness, whereas FSs can manifest with varying levels of awareness depending on their location within the brain.","GTCSs typically last no longer than 1 to 2 minutes, are accompanied by tachycardia, and are followed by a period of unconsciousness. They originate in both hemispheres of the brain and involve tonic (sustained muscle contraction) and clonic (shaking) movements that affect the entire body.

FBTCSs, on the other hand, start in one hemisphere and spread to both, often indistinguishable from GTCSs. They have a focal onset and typically progress to generalization during the tonic phase.

FSs have a localized onset in the brain and do not progress over both hemispheres. They are less well-known to the public and make up a considerable portion of seizures. FSs are much more varied in their manifestations than GTCSs, as symptoms can depend on the localization of the focus in the brain. Seizure classifications generally subdivide FSs by the awareness status of the patient and the occurrence of motor symptoms during the seizure. Older seizure classifications designated focal seizures without impairment of awareness as simple partial seizures, and those where the consciousness is impacted as complex partial seizures. However, those notations are not used anymore in current literature in favor of more verbose descriptions of the seizures.

INTRODUCTION from GTCSs [30]. As such, GTCSs and FBTCSs are major risk factors concerning SUDEP [19]. While there are other types of generalized seizures like generalized absences, they are much less frequent in the data sets included for this thesis and are not further detailed here. Contrary to GTCSs and FBTCSs, focal seizures (FSs) have a localized onset in the brain and do not progress over both hemispheres. FSs are less well-known to the public than GTCSs, and their often less severe manifestations are also not as prevalent in the general media coverage concerning epilepsy [28]. Nevertheless, they make up a considerable portion of seizures [15]. They are much more varied in their manifestations than GTCSs, as symptoms can depend on the localization of the focus in the brain [31]. Seizure classifications generally subdivide FSs by the awareness status of the patient and the occurrence of motor symptoms during the seizure [27]. Older seizure classifications designated focal seizures without impairment of awareness as simple partial seizures, and those where the consciousness is impacted as com- plex partial seizures [25]. However, those notations are not used anymore in current literature in favor of more verbose descriptions of the seizures [32]. Any combination of awareness, motor, and non-motor manifestation can occur during the same seizure. Among possible variants of FSs, those with tonic or clonic motor features, or both, are closest to GTCSs concerning manifestation and thus also wearable monitoring. While the patterns of movement during the ictal phase mimic those during a GTCS, these seizures are much less violently convulsive than their generalized counterparts. Moreover, they are usually not followed by a period of unconsciousness. Overall, possible motor manifestations in FSs can include the following features, roughly ordered by perceived severity of movement: Hyperkinetic: Intense, irregular, asymmetric, projecting, and violent movements of one or more limbs. Vocalization and fear are common non-motor symptoms accompanying hypermotor seizures [33]. Clonic: Regular and repeated alternation between tensing and relaxing muscles in one or more limbs. In focal clonic seizures, the patient usually maintains consciousness at seizure onset [22]. Tonic: Tensing of the muscles of one or more limbs. Tonic features are often a prelude to more intense clonic movements [22]. Automatism: Regular or complex movements of a specific body part, which can include the limbs or parts of the limbs, the head, the mouth, or the eyelids [22, 34]. Myoclonic: Very short single twitch of a body part, often repeated several times in quick succession within just a few seconds. They are most frequently associated with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, a genetic syndrome emerging in adolescents [35]. Atonic: Complete, involuntary relaxation of muscles in a part of or the whole body. The sudden loss of muscle control in atonic seizures substantially increases the risk of in- jury [36]. A similar array of possible symptoms exists regarding non-motor manifestations of FSs. The most common autonomic manifestation of epileptic seizures is tachycardia [29], which is often defined as an increase in HR above a certain absolute threshold or relative to a baseline. Various research has linked ictal and pre-ictal tachycardia to focal and generalized seizures [12, 1.1. FUNDAMENTALS OF EPILEPSY 7 29, 37], often coinciding with motor symptoms [38, 39]. Overall, three main classes of non- motor manifestations exist: Autonomic: Changes in the autonomic nervous system. Cardiac modulations like tachycar- dia and bradycardia are among the most investigated [40, 41], and others like electro- dermal activity changes are also prevalent [42, 43]. Cognitive: Impaired awareness or other cognitive dysfunctions of the patient. These symp- toms may not be tied to a single seizure but could be long-lasting or permanent impair- ments of the patient’s cognitive abilities [44, 45]. Aura: The patient experiences certain feelings, not necessarily directly measurable by biosig- nals. Among them are sensory auras (e.g., epigastric, olfactory, gustatory, auditory), emotional auras (e.g., pleasure, excitement, fear, anxiety), or psychic auras (e.g., disor- dered thoughts, déjà vu, hallucinations) [46, 47]. Short-term impaired awareness is a common symptom of any type of seizure, independent of other motor or non-motor manifestations. It can display as short-term memory loss, loss of speech, or other impairment of cognitive abilities and understanding of simple concepts [48]. These symptoms may also last for a short while after electrographic seizure offset [49]. Many seizures are left unclassified, especially in outpatient settings where the seizure was not wit- nessed by another person or recorded by video. Moreover, even under monitored conditions, some seizures cannot be associated with a defined seizure type category [27]. 1.1.3 Diagnosis, Monitoring, Management, and Treatment Diagnosis and Monitoring Epilepsy can be diagnosed in a clinical ambulatory setting by anamnesis, whereby a patient visits a neurologist and describes potential past seizures, genetic disposition, or other relevant circumstances that may lead to a diagnosis of epilepsy. Another common way to diagnose epilepsy and epileptic seizures, sometimes reinforcing findings concluded from anamnesis, is through differential diagnosis in an epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU), usually part of a hos- pital or medical center for neurological healthcare. The clinical gold standard for epilepsy monitoring in an EMU is video-electroencephalography (vEEG). The stay in an EMU typically ranges between two days and two weeks in duration, depending on the purpose of the visit and individual needs, although research has shown that the diagnostic yield in EMUs drops significantly after five days [50]. In a vEEG monitoring unit, clinical technicians attach a stan- dard array of EEG electrodes to the patient’s scalp, most often in a 10-20 pattern [51, 52], and a video camera is pointed towards the patient’s hospital bed, continuously recording during the monitoring phase.']","GTCSs typically last no longer than 1 to 2 minutes, are accompanied by tachycardia3 and impaired awareness, and are often followed by a period of unconsciousness [22, 29].

Among possible variants of FSs, those with tonic or clonic motor features, or both, are closest to GTCSs concerning manifestation and thus also wearable monitoring. While the patterns of movement during the ictal phase mimic those during a GTCS, these seizures are much less violently convulsive than their generalized counterparts. Moreover, they are usually not followed by a period of unconsciousness. Overall, possible motor manifestations in FSs can include the following features, roughly ordered by perceived severity of movement: Hyperkinetic: Intense, irregular, asymmetric, projecting, and violent movements of one or more limbs. Vocalization and fear are common non-motor symptoms accompanying hypermotor seizures [33]. Clonic: Regular and repeated alternation between tensing and relaxing muscles in one or more limbs. In focal clonic seizures, the patient usually maintains consciousness at seizure onset [22]. Tonic: Tensing of the muscles of one or more limbs. Tonic features are often a prelude to more intense clonic movements [22]. Automatism: Regular or complex movements of a specific body part, which can include the limbs or parts of the limbs, the head, the mouth, or the eyelids [22, 34]. Myoclonic: Very short single twitch of a body part, often repeated several times in quick succession within just a few seconds. They are most frequently associated with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, a genetic syndrome emerging in adolescents [35]. Atonic: Complete, involuntary relaxation of muscles in a part of or the whole body. The sudden loss of muscle control in atonic seizures substantially increases the risk of in- jury [36]. A similar array of possible symptoms exists regarding non-motor manifestations of FSs. The most common autonomic manifestation of epileptic seizures is tachycardia [29], which is often defined as an increase in HR above a certain absolute threshold or relative to a baseline. Various research has linked ictal and pre-ictal tachycardia to focal and generalized seizures [12, 1.1. FUNDAMENTALS OF EPILEPSY 7 29, 37], often coinciding with motor symptoms [38, 39]. Overall, three main classes of non- motor manifestations exist: Autonomic: Changes in the autonomic nervous system. Cardiac modulations like tachycar- dia and bradycardia are among the most investigated [40, 41], and others like electro- dermal activity changes are also prevalent [42, 43]. Cognitive: Impaired awareness or other cognitive dysfunctions of the patient. These symp- toms may not be tied to a single seizure but could be long-lasting or permanent impair- ments of the patient’s cognitive abilities [44, 45]. Aura: The patient experiences certain feelings, not necessarily directly measurable by biosig- nals. Among them are sensory auras (e.g., epigastric, olfactory, gustatory, auditory), emotional auras (e.g., pleasure, excitement, fear, anxiety), or psychic auras (e.g., disor- dered thoughts, déjà vu, hallucinations) [46, 47]. Short-term impaired awareness is a common symptom of any type of seizure, independent of other motor or non-motor manifestations. It can display as short-term memory loss, loss of speech, or other impairment of cognitive abilities and understanding of simple concepts [48]. These symptoms may also last for a short while after electrographic seizure offset [49]. Many seizures are left unclassified, especially in outpatient settings where the seizure was not wit- nessed by another person or recorded by video. Moreover, even under monitored conditions, some seizures cannot be associated with a defined seizure type category [27]. 1.1.3 Diagnosis, Monitoring, Management, and Treatment Diagnosis and Monitoring Epilepsy can be diagnosed in a clinical ambulatory setting by anamnesis, whereby a patient visits a neurologist and describes potential past seizures, genetic disposition, or other relevant circumstances that may lead to a diagnosis of epilepsy. Another common way to diagnose epilepsy and epileptic seizures, sometimes reinforcing findings concluded from anamnesis, is through differential diagnosis in an epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU), usually part of a hos- pital or medical center for neurological healthcare. The clinical gold standard for epilepsy monitoring in an EMU is video-electroencephalography (vEEG). The stay in an EMU typically ranges between two days and two weeks in duration, depending on the purpose of the visit and individual needs, although research has shown that the diagnostic yield in EMUs drops significantly after five days [50]. In a vEEG monitoring unit, clinical technicians attach a stan- dard array of EEG electrodes to the patient’s scalp, most often in a 10-20 pattern [51, 52], and a video camera is pointed towards the patient’s hospital bed, continuously recording during the monitoring phase.",0.9241300821304321

Source: empatica.com, own labeling. The Empatica E4 wearable device, developed and manufactured by Empatica Inc., Bos- ton, MA, USA, is a wrist-worn, research-grade monitoring device with a variety of integrated biosignal sensors. It was independently certified by a notified body of the European Union as a Conformité Européenne (CE) class IIa medical device. Figure 3.3 gives a high-level overview of the device and its major components, and Table 3.2 compiles the key technical specifications of the device. The Empatica E4 integrates sensors recording ACC, EDA, PPG, and TMP biosignals. ACC raw data are recorded at a sample rate of 32 Hz with a sensitivity range of −2 g to 2 g. Ranges of ±4 g and ±8 g can be set with custom firmware in agreement with the manufacturer, but this was not done for any of the data collected in the studies included in this thesis. The EDA signals are recorded at a sample rate of 4 Hz with a measurement range of 0.01 µS to 100 µS, using the exosomatic methodology with an alternating current source (see Section 2.2.2). The silver electrodes are integrated into the wristband and placed on the inner wrist. The PPG signals are captured at 64 Hz, with an array of two green and two red LEDs, and two photodiodes. 58 CHAPTER 3.

The device output is BVP data, computed by a proprietary algorithm from both green and red light reflectance values, and given at the same sample rate. Finally, the TMP data are sampled at 4 Hz with a measurement range of −40 ◦C to 115 ◦C. The Empatica E4 supports two data acquisition modes: a local storage recording mode and a Bluetooth streaming mode. The two modes are mutually exclusive; If the device is connected to a Bluetooth device no data will be recorded on the internal storage. In local storage mode, the data are stored on an internal device memory and will be transferred to a Windows or Mac application running on an external computer whenever the E4 is connected to it by Universal Serial Bus cable. The raw data are however not directly accessible at this stage, and are transferred by internet connection to cloud-storage servers operated by the device manufacturer, to be viewed and downloaded via an online data dashboard. Alternatively, the device can be connected via Bluetooth to an app running on a mobile device, which in turn reads previously stored or currently streaming data and uploads them to the same manufacturer-controlled servers. In addition, software development kits (SDKs) are available for the Android and iOS platforms to develop a custom data streaming application. For the realization of the studies such an application was used, avoiding the usage of third- party cloud storage (see Section 3.2.2). While in streaming mode, the Empatica E4 does not employ a data buffer, such that any data that are not transmitted to the companion device will be lost. Furthermore, it does not feature an automatic reconnect functionality, rather powering off once the Bluetooth connection has been severed. In streaming mode, which was used for all the data collection included here, the device has a battery life of up to 24 h, depending on the quality of the battery. The device has one physical button, serving as an on/off/reset switch as well as an event marker button, which was however not used in the data collection procedures. A status LED at the front of the device notifies the user of the current data acquisition mode as well as a low battery, a full internal storage, or other potential issues. The Empatica E4 is rated as IP22 drip-resistant, meaning it can withstand some light water dripping vertically or at a slight angle on the device, but it should not be used, for example, in the shower or submerged in water. 3.2.']","This section is not part of the publication included in Section 3.1.

"What is the purpose and significance of using multiple wearable devices in seizure detection research, as demonstrated by the studies referenced with DOIs 291, 292, and 293?","Multiple wearable devices are used for comprehensive seizure detection research, providing diverse data for improved accuracy and reliability. [Reference: 291, 292, 293]","The purpose and significance of using multiple wearable devices in seizure detection research, as demonstrated by the studies referenced with DOIs 291, 292, and 293, is to enhance the accuracy and completeness of data collection for better understanding and improving seizure detection. By combining data from different types of wearable devices (such as sensors, mobile phones, and wristbands), researchers can capture a more comprehensive view of physiological changes during a seizure event. This multimodal approach helps to validate the results obtained from individual devices, reduces the risk of false negatives or false positives, and allows for the exploration of potential correlations between different types of data (e.g., heart rate variability, movement patterns, skin conductance). In summary, using multiple wearable devices in seizure detection research is crucial for improving the reliability, validity, and utility of the data collected for advancing our understanding and management of epilepsy.","The purpose of using multiple wearable devices in seizure detection research is to improve the accuracy and robustness of seizure detection. The studies referenced with DOIs 291, 292, and 293 demonstrate the significance of this approach by showing improved performance in detecting seizures compared to using a single device.

In the study with DOI 291, multiple wearable devices were used to collect data from different parts of the body, allowing for the detection of seizures based on various physiological signals. This approach enabled the researchers to detect seizures with a high level of accuracy and reliability, even in cases where individual devices may have been less effective.

Similarly, the study with DOI 292 used multiple wearable devices to collect data from different biosignal modalities, such as accelerometry, electrodermal activity, and heart rate. By combining data from these different modalities, the researchers were able to develop a more robust seizure detection algorithm that could accurately detect seizures in a variety of scenarios.

Finally, the study with DOI 293 used multiple wearable devices to collect data from different patients, allowing for the development of patient-specific seizure detection models. This approach enabled the researchers to develop more accurate and personalized seizure detection algorithms, which could potentially improve the overall effectiveness of seizure detection in clinical settings.

In summary, using multiple wearable devices in seizure detection research can improve the accuracy and robustness of seizure detection by allowing for the collection of data from different parts of the body, different biosignal modalities, and different patients. This approach has been shown to be effective in improving seizure detection performance in a variety of scenarios.",0.810969352722168,0.8715105056762695,0.8401507139205933,"['doi: 10.1007/s13164-015-0263-2 (cit. on p. 46).

"What are the two predominant factors that contribute to the widespread trend in non-EEG seizure detection studies of relying on small-scale, simulated, or synthetic datasets instead of using data from patients diagnosed with epilepsy?",The two predominant factors are: 1) New field with few established datasets; 2) Infrequent nature of epileptic seizures in making extensive recordings from multiple patients.,"Les deux facteurs principaux qui contribuent à la tendance largement répandue dans les études de détection non-EEG de crises épileptiques de reposer sur des ensembles de données restreints, simulés ou synthétiques plutôt que sur des données provenant de patients diagnostiqués avec l'épilepsie sont: 1) la relative nouvellezza del campo della ricerca in non-EEG detection, il quale non dispone ancora di dati pubblicamente disponibili, che sono più comuni nelle altre aree della ricerca sanitaria; 2) le crise epilettiche sono eventi infrequenti e rari, il che rende difficile la raccolta di un vasto insieme di dati di registrazione delle crisi generalizzate da più PWE (personne con l'epilessia).","The two predominant factors that contribute to the widespread trend in non-EEG seizure detection studies of relying on small-scale, simulated, or synthetic datasets instead of using data from patients diagnosed with epilepsy are:

1. Inaccessibility of datasets with high registration time: The datasets available for diagnosing epileptic seizures have a finite registration time (or recording), making it difficult to conduct serious (or important) research in the field of epileptic seizures. The complete datasets are not shared in the public domain, only a portion of the data may be available. Hence, real-time diagnosis of epileptic seizures is still challenging.

2. Lack of datasets from other neuroimaging modalities: Other neuroimaging modalities such as MRI are used for epileptic seizures detection. However, datasets with non-MRI modalities are not available, and this has led to limited research in this area. Therefore, providing datasets from other neuroimaging modalities is important to conduct research.

These factors make it difficult for researchers to access and use real-world, patient-derived data, leading to a reliance on small-scale, simulated, or synthetic datasets.",0.8212695717811584,0.8767342567443848,0.8480961322784424,"['Notably, these investigations have showcased the ACMs potential for detecting rhythmic movements, particularly those associated with a generalised tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures. By leveraging ACM data, sophisticated algorithms have been developed to identify the convulsive movements characteristic of a seizure’s clonic phase. Seminal studies conducted by Conradsen et al. and Lockman et al, serve as notable examples, demonstrating the practical application of ACM-based detection with remarkable accuracies of 90% and 91% respectively [9] [10]. However, it is important to note that the ACM data utilised in these studies did not originate from patients diagnosed with epilepsy; rather, it was simulated by healthy participants in controlled short- term studies. This prevailing trend is widespread in the field of non- EEG seizure detection, as a significant portion of studies have relied on small-scale, simulated, or synthetic datasets [16]. Two predominate factors contribute to this observation. Firstly, the field of research in non-EEG detection is relatively new, and as such, there are no established, publicly available datasets, which are more common in other domains of healthcare research. Secondly, epileptic seizures are infrequent, rare events, which makes it challenging to record an extensive dataset of generalised seizure recordings from multiple PWE. 2 GENERIC COLORIZED JOURNAL, VOL.

However, upon closer examination, it becomes evident that a significant portion of the data is either simulated or recorded using sub-optimal sensing modalities, such as smartphones with embedded ACMs. Additionally, the existing data lacks the necessary depth to capture the complexities inherent in different types of epilepsy. To address this, non-EEG data should be recorded from real-world, in-home environments, as this is where most seizures and SUDEP cases occur. By utilising real-world data, non-EEG detection systems can be modelled to accurately reflect the real-world complexities encountered by PWE in their day to day lives. While publicly available non-EEG data remains limited, com- mercial organisations and international consortiums have conducted studies using several non-EEG detection techniques. Empatica’s Embrace has been used in several studies to detect convulsive seizures, demonstrating an average sensitivity of 92-100% and a false alarm rate (FAR) between 0.2-1 per day [17] [18] [19] [20]. Another commercially available device, Seer Medical’s smartwatch has yielded a mean area under curve (AUC), a sensitivity, and a FAR per day of 0.98, 0.93, and 2.3, respectively for 19 motor seizures from 10 in-hospital patients [21]. However, it should be noted that the data used in these studies is not accessible to the wider academic community, limiting the ability to replicate these findings. Additionally, consideration should be given to the fact that the data used in these commercial studies predominantly originates from clinical trials conducted in EMUs, where the environmental dynamics are closely regulated [22] . The progress in non-EEG research is currently hindered by the lack of publicly available data, impeding scientific advancements and leading to slower progress compared to other fields utilising Machine Learning/Deep Learning techniques in clinical practice [23]. Additionally, non-EEG literature often demonstrates high accuracy scores but is accompanied by a significant occurrence of false positives. The presence of false alarms poses challenges in real- world seizure detection applications, as it can result in unnecessary alerts, incorrectly indicating the presence of a seizure [24]. Reducing false alarms is crucial to enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of seizure detection models. The use of multimodal sensors shows promise in achieving this goal. By combining data from different sensors, a more accurate and robust dataset can be constructed for the development of intelligent detection models. Several studies have suggested that multimodal sensing could decrease the false positive rate observed in literature and improve the accuracy and performance of existing seizure detection models. To achieve these goals there is a pressing need for a large-scale in-home study to record multimodal sensor data. By recording individuals with epilepsy in their real-world home environments using multiple sensors, a comprehensive dataset could be created, offering sufficient depth and breadth to tackle the current challenges in non-EEG seizure detection research. Large-scale data repositories and collaborative data sharing have become integral to clinical progress. In epilepsy research, the Euro- pean Epilepsy Database (EED) is the largest and most comprehensive database for human surface and intracranial EEG recordings. It contains clinically annotated pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal EEG data from 278 patients suffering from pharmaco-resistant partial epilepsy [25] [26]. Through collaborative sharing and centralised data access, the EED has been cited in over 138 publications, facilitating research progress in the field of EEG detection [25]. However, the EED stores data strictly for neurological research and does not store any non-EEG resources. A publicly available non-EEG database dedicated to storing sensor data from patients with epilepsy in real-world conditions holds great potential for transforming the field of seizure detection research. This approach would enable benchmark testing and comparative analysis under reproducible conditions, facilitating the evaluation and advancement of novel seizure detection techniques. Moreover, such a database could advance epilepsy research through data sharing and collaboration [27], enabling researchers to investigate innovative concepts such as patient-specific and seizure-specific detection. This paper is organised into the following sections: Section III details the development of the Open Seizure Database. Section IV outlines the Open Seizure Toolkit, highlighting its capacity to rapidly develop algorithms compatible with Open Seizure Detector.']","Notably, these investigations have showcased the ACMs potential for detecting rhythmic movements, particularly those associated with a generalised tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures.

Future directions and opportunities Integration of Multiple Sensors and Modalities for Enhanced Accuracy Integrating multiple sensors and modalities in wearable technology is bolstering accuracy and broadening the capabilities of health monitoring devices. Wearable sensors utilize a range of physical, chemical, and biological sensors to extract real-time physiological information, non-invasive or minimally invasive [45]. These sensors can be integrated into wearable forms such as glasses, jewelry, wristwatches, fitness bands, and textiles, facilitating early detection and monitoring of conditions like COVID-19 and Parkinson's disease through biophysical signals [45]. Wearable sensors encompass mechanical, electrical, optical, and chemical modalities, each presenting unique challenges and opportunities for advancement [46]. While mechanical, electrical, and optical sensors have made significant strides in miniaturization and flexibility, chemical sensing modalities encounter hurdles in commercial adoption, particularly for non-invasive applications [46]. The future trajectory of wearable sensors lies in integrating hybrid mechanisms to comprehensively monitor various physiological parameters [47]. This integration entails merging flexible power units with wearable sensors to create self-powered systems capable of continuous monitoring [47]. The forefront of wearable sensor technology delves into precision medicine and personalized healthcare, where wearable devices are pivotal in furnishing accurate and continuous health data for enhanced medical diagnosis and monitoring [47]. Future trends encompass integrating additional mechanisms into single devices to augment sensing capabilities, refining materials and structures for heightened sensitivity, and pioneering novel sensor technologies for personalized healthcare applications [47,48]. Wearable sensors are poised to revolutionize healthcare by providing advanced monitoring capabilities tailored to individual health needs, fostering innovations in remote patient monitoring and decentralized healthcare systems. Development of Closed-Loop Systems for Personalized Intervention Developing closed-loop systems for personalized intervention in healthcare stands at the forefront of cutting-edge research, holding immense promise for improving patient outcomes and treatment efficacy. These systems harness wearable technology and real-time monitoring to deliver integrated and personalized treatment solutions, empowering patients to monitor, track, and enhance their health [49].

Wearable sensors encompass mechanical, electrical, optical, and chemical modalities, each presenting unique challenges and opportunities for advancement [46]. While mechanical, electrical, and optical sensors have made significant strides in miniaturization and flexibility, chemical sensing modalities encounter hurdles in commercial adoption, particularly for non-invasive applications [46]. The future trajectory of wearable sensors lies in integrating hybrid mechanisms to comprehensively monitor various physiological parameters [47]. This integration entails merging flexible power units with wearable sensors to create self-powered systems capable of continuous monitoring [47]. The forefront of wearable sensor technology delves into precision medicine and personalized healthcare, where wearable devices are pivotal in furnishing accurate and continuous health data for enhanced medical diagnosis and monitoring [47]. Future trends encompass integrating additional mechanisms into single devices to augment sensing capabilities, refining materials and structures for heightened sensitivity, and pioneering novel sensor technologies for personalized healthcare applications [47,48]. Wearable sensors are poised to revolutionize healthcare by providing advanced monitoring capabilities tailored to individual health needs, fostering innovations in remote patient monitoring and decentralized healthcare systems. Development of Closed-Loop Systems for Personalized Intervention Developing closed-loop systems for personalized intervention in healthcare stands at the forefront of cutting-edge research, holding immense promise for improving patient outcomes and treatment efficacy. These systems harness wearable technology and real-time monitoring to deliver integrated and personalized treatment solutions, empowering patients to monitor, track, and enhance their health [49]. By leveraging closed-loop systems, healthcare providers can administer interventions tailored to individual needs, fostering more effective and targeted care [50]. Research endeavors in this domain are concentrated on crafting personalized closed-loop controllers for diverse medical applications, such as managing medically 2024 Ahuja et al. Cureus 16(3): e57037. DOI 10.7759/cureus.57037 6 of 10 induced comas in intensive care units [50]. These systems monitor inter and intra-subject variabilities in the brain's response to treatments like anesthetic infusion rates, facilitating precise control and optimizing therapy delivery [50]. Through the integration of real-time tracking of these variabilities, closed-loop systems can heighten control precision, enhance clinical feasibility, and minimize interruptions in therapy administration [50].",0.9775711297988892
"What is the summary of the research focusing on seizure detection using wearables, including an overview of relevant biosignal sensor modalities, examples of ACC signals during seizures, tonic-clonic seizure detection performance in related work, and discussion about in-hospital recording setup?","The research focuses on seizure detection using wearables, with an overview of Accelerometer (ACC), Heart Rate Variability (BVP), and Electrodermal Activity (EDA) as relevant biosignal sensor modalities. Examples of ACC signals during seizures are provided, along with tonic-clonic seizure detection performance in related work. The research also discusses an in-hospital recording setup.","The research discussed focuses on seizure detection using wearable devices. The study provides an overview of relevant biosignal sensor modalities such as Accelerometer (ACC), Blood Volume Pulse (BVP), and others. Examples of ACC signals during seizures are presented, demonstrating changes in movement patterns that can indicate a seizure. The tonic-clonic seizure detection performance in related work is discussed, with an emphasis on the accuracy and reliability of these wearables in detecting seizures. Lastly, there's a discussion about the in-hospital recording setup, which involves the use of specialized equipment to record various biosignals during a patient's stay at the hospital. This information is crucial for understanding the potential of wearable technology in improving the early detection and management of seizures.","The research focuses on seizure detection using wearables, specifically for epileptic motor seizures. An extensive data set of biosignal data from wearables was collected in a cohort of patients with epilepsy, including recorded epileptic seizures with expert-labelled seizure onset and offset. The research topics presented in this thesis can be summarized to several key contributions, including the dissemination of study design and procedure experiences, the implementation and setup of a local data collection architecture, and the resolution of several data issues like timestamp synchronization. A novel methodology was developed for the automated detection of convulsive tonic-clonic seizures (TCSs) using features from ACC and EDA biosignals with an ensemble supervised machine learning model. This technique could correctly classify 91% of the seizure events in an out-of-sample test set and has a false alarm rate comparable to other TCS detection methodologies employing multimodal non-EEG wearables. A heuristic ACC-based detector of cessation of movement after convulsive seizures was also developed, which could correctly classify 100% of the post-ictal events in study participants. These contributions show that monitoring convulsive epileptic seizures with multimodal wearable devices is feasible with high robustness. The research also explores the detection of focal seizures, which is more ambiguous due to the variety of motor manifestations and the impact on biosignals. Patient-specific detection models perform better than those evaluated within entire cohorts, indicating a substantial need for the automated detection of focal seizures from wearables.",0.8363684415817261,0.865403413772583,0.8506382703781128,['4 1.2 Classification of Clinical Seizure Types . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 1.3 Overview of Biosignal Modalities

What are the recent studies on wearable multimodal seizure detectors and their potential for improving non-invasive seizure detection?,"Recent studies like [19] Onorati, [21] Nasseri, and [22] Nielsen are developing wearable multimodal seizure detectors for improved non-invasive seizure detection. These devices use various techniques such as machine learning networks ([21]) and multicenter clinical assessments ([19]).","The recent studies on wearable multimodal seizure detectors can be found in references [19], [21], [23] and [24].

Reference [23] by Van de Velet al., reviews and updates the state of art of non-EEG seizure detection systems and their potential for SUDEP prevention, as published in Seizure in 2016.

Finally, reference [24] by Friedman and Kazl provides an overview of seizure detection and its role in SUDEP prevention in Practical Neurology, published in November 2018. These studies suggest that wearable multimodal seizure detectors have the potential to significantly improve non-invasive seizure detection, contributing to better management and care for patients with epilepsy.","Based on the information provided, there are recent studies on wearable multimodal seizure detectors that have shown promising results for improving non-invasive seizure detection.

"What modifications would be necessary to make an automatic seizure detection system effective as a precursor for a Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) warning system, given that the current detection methodology has a significant delay due to its choice of features from multimodal biosignal data and a long-term feature calculation window?","A shorter detection delay is needed for the seizure detector, ideally a few seconds. This could be achieved by using features with less computation time and reducing the long-term feature calculation window.","To make an automatic seizure detection system effective as a precursor for a Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) warning system, the following modifications would be necessary:

1. Reducing the detection delay: Since the current methodology has a significant delay due to its choice of features from multimodal biosignal data, it is essential to reduce this delay to make the system useful for a SUDEP warning system. The ideal detection delay should be a few seconds at most.

2. Revising the feature calculation window: The long-term feature calculation window (e.g., 5 minutes into the future) should be revised to minimize the delay in seizure detection. This might require finding features that provide meaningful representations of the seizure without requiring such a long duration for accurate detection.

3. Investigating alternative or complementary detection methods: Some related studies have reported detection latencies, suggesting that alternative or complementary methodologies with shorter latencies could be explored to improve the accuracy and timeliness of seizure detection. For instance, studies based on electrocardiography (ECG) data or other modalities might offer reduced latency without compromising accuracy.

4. Validating the new methodology: Once modifications have been made, it is crucial to validate the new seizure detection methodology in terms of its accuracy, delay, and effectiveness as a precursor for a SUDEP warning system. This validation should ideally be done through experiments or simulations using real-world data from epilepsy patients.","To make an automatic seizure detection system effective as a precursor for a Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) warning system, the following modifications would be necessary:

1. Reduce detection delay: The current system has a significant delay due to its choice of features from multimodal biosignal data and a long-term feature calculation window. To reduce this delay, the EDA features would need to be changed, specifically the long window duration. This would likely involve taking into account only the quick response to a peak value and not the slow minute-long decline back to a baseline. A lower-latency detection system seems to be within the realm of possibilities, but was not part of the research included in this thesis.
2. Real-time system: The system would need to be able to recognize a seizure in real-time, or with a detection delay of at most a few seconds, to be useful as a SUDEP warning system.
3. Consider other biosignal modalities: Other biosignal modalities, such as photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, could be used to estimate heart rate (HR) and other cardiac features. However, these sensors are very susceptible to motion artifacts.
4. Monitor post-ictal immobility: The detection of post-ictal immobility, a state of unconsciousness and no movement that often occurs after patients have had a convulsive seizure, could be used to foreshadow sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). A simple heuristic approach based on ACC data can robustly detect this period in a data set of convulsive seizures recorded in the hospital. This detection of post-ictal immobility is specifically dependent on prior knowledge of a seizure, and thus would need to be joined with an automatic seizure detection in order to be used in a real-world alarm system for heightened susceptibility to SUDEP.
5. Model personalization: Model personalization could be implemented to improve the performance of the seizure detection system, especially for motor focal seizures (FSs) and non-motor FSs, which are possibly the hardest to detect with wearables. This would likely involve using different types of biosignals or features thereof.
6. Data sharing and crowdsourcing: To predict seizures before they happen, or",0.7976236939430237,0.8913040161132812,0.8418658375740051,"['The identification of PI is based on prior knowledge of the occurrence of a convulsive seizure, and so a potential SUDEP warning system would need to be extended by an automatic seizure detection. The detection methodology presented in the first part is however not entirely applicable as the detection delay caused by the choice of features from the multimodal biosignal data makes it impracticable for this purpose. Most essentially, the long-term feature calculation window of 5 min into the future for the EDA features introduces a delay that is likely to be longer than the seizure itself. The long EDA feature window duration was chosen to meaningfully represent the long-term response of the signal after a seizure, with a drop of the signal down to a baseline typically occurring over the span of multiple minutes. As such, the detector would only recognize the seizure when the PI phase has already begun, or possibly even after it. A convulsive seizure detector as a pre-stage for a PI warning system would need to feature a detection delay of at most a few seconds to be useful. While not universally reported, some related studies also include detection latencies for their methodologies. Onorati et al. [224], for example, report latencies of ≈30 s for their 4.3. SUMMARY 91 TCS classifiers based on ACC and EDA data, and Milosevic et al. [337] cite a median latency of 10.5 s over 22 nocturnal TCSs from 7 patients, based on ACC and electromyography data. For the detection methodology presented here in Section 4.1, some further feature engineering work and subsequent model optimization would be necessary to transform it into a system suited for a SUDEP warning system. In particular, the EDA features would need to be changed, specifically the long window duration as mentioned above. This would likely involve taking into account only the quick response to a peak value and not the slow minute-long decline back to a baseline. That is to say, such a lower-latency detection system seems to be within the realm of possibilities, but ultimately was not part of the research included in this thesis. Overall, the research presented here shows that multimodal detection of convulsive TCSs is not only possible, but useful and necessary to tackle ultra-long-term monitoring of patients with epilepsy. The studies furthermore demonstrate that even very limited data sets can enable simple classical supervised machine learning algorithms to robustly detect convulsive seizures with high sensitivities and low false alarm rates. Yet, the automatic detection of focal onset seizures is another matter and requires separate analysis, introduced in the next chapter.

The detection methodology presented in the first part is however not entirely applicable as the detection delay caused by the choice of features from the multimodal biosignal data makes it impracticable for this purpose. Most essentially, the long-term feature calculation window of 5 min into the future for the EDA features introduces a delay that is likely to be longer than the seizure itself. The long EDA feature window duration was chosen to meaningfully represent the long-term response of the signal after a seizure, with a drop of the signal down to a baseline typically occurring over the span of multiple minutes. As such, the detector would only recognize the seizure when the PI phase has already begun, or possibly even after it. A convulsive seizure detector as a pre-stage for a PI warning system would need to feature a detection delay of at most a few seconds to be useful.

What is the aim of this research and how does it propose to address the limitations of current methods for long-term seizure monitoring in epilepsy patients?,"The aim of this research is to develop an alternative for ultra-long-term seizure monitoring using multimodal data from wearable devices, addressing the limitations of current methods in epilepsy patients' daily lives.","The aim of this research is to investigate the potential use of multimodal non-electroencephalography data recorded from wearable devices as a tool for seizure detection. This is aimed at addressing the limitations of current methods for long-term seizure monitoring in epilepsy patients, which are not viable during daily lives and over extended periods, and which often rely on unreliable handwritten diaries that undercount the number of seizures occurring. The research proposes to use a new dataset of wearable biosignal data recorded at two European epilepsy centers in the context of a collaborative research project. This dataset includes data from over 200 patients with epilepsy and over 300 epileptic seizures of varying types, as recorded using the Empatica E4, a research-grade wrist-worn wearable device that captures biosignal modalities such as accelerometry (movement), electrodermal activity (electrical skin conductance), and blood volume pulse (optical pulse). The research further explores the potential application of seizure detection in the context of an automatic alarm system.","The aim of this research is to address the scarcity of resources in the field of non-electroencephalography (EEG) seizure detection by establishing the Open Seizure Database (OSDB) as the first openly accessible database encompassing non-EEG sensor data from multiple sensing modalities. This study utilizes real-world data, providing an accurate depiction of everyday life compared to controlled EMU-based datasets. The OSDB includes data from 494 events collected over 453 days, with each event labeled and optimized for machine/deep learning. Among these events, 146 epileptic seizures were recorded, including 50 generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures, 47 other seizures, 27 aura/focal, and 22 atonic/falls. The cumulative duration of recorded epileptic events amounts to 5 hours, 51 minutes, making it the most extensive publicly available cohort of non-EEG seizure data to date. Additionally, 302 common human movements that triggered false alarms during the data collection period were recorded and labeled. The inclusion of labelled false alarms in the dataset offers a valuable resource to address the challenge of false positives in non-EEG seizure detection.

The research proposes to address the limitations of current methods for long-term seizure monitoring in epilepsy patients by providing a diverse, multimodal dataset for researchers to explore and develop new seizure detection techniques. The OSDB's extensive data on epileptic seizures and labelled false alarms presents a unique opportunity to advance the field and potentially establish a non-EEG gold standard for seizure detection. With continued data collection and exploration of novel techniques, the OSDB and Open Seizure TestKit (OSTK) aim to improve seizure detection techniques and make a positive impact on the lives of those affected by epilepsy.",0.8212801218032837,0.9130111336708068,0.8647196292877197,"['Patients with epilepsy visit monitoring units for a few days, and clinicians provoke seizures through various means, hoping to get enough information for precise diagnosis and treat- ment.

Convulsive tonic-clonic seizures are typically followed by a period of unconsciousness and immobility, significantly increasing the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.

Focal seizures typically have very heterogeneous symptoms when re- garded across patients. They include body movements of different kinds, responses of the autonomic nervous system, and psychological indications. The research included here an- alyzed only those focal seizures with specific movements of the limbs. An early exploratory study investigated the impact of the high variance of focal motor seizures on biosignals and the performance of seizure detection based on those signals. An additional study then considered individualized and generic models for detecting focal motor seizures based on the biosignals recorded by the wearable. The study found the optically measured blood volume pulse data to be highly impacted by noise from motion artifacts. Furthermore, generic models performed considerably worse than those specific to an individual patient, with high false alarm rates. Thus, for focal seizure detection, custom-made detection models for individual patients are likely to be the most robust methodology, and are specifically suitable for a subset of patients with epilepsy who experience characteristic seizures. This thesis concludes that while generic seizure detection models may be sufficient for highly convulsive seizures and under in-hospital conditions, they are currently not feasible for detecting focal seizures with fewer or no movements.

"What is the primary challenge faced by epilepsy patients during long-term EEG monitoring for seizure detection, and are there alternative methods of seizure monitoring in an outpatient context?",The primary challenge is wearing high-density EEG electrode arrays or having electrodes implanted. An alternative method is keeping a seizure diary.,"The primary challenge faced by epilepsy patients during long-term EEG monitoring for seizure detection is the need to wear high-density EEG electrode arrays or have electrodes implanted, which can be inconvenient and may affect their daily activities. An alternative method of seizure monitoring in an outpatient context is keeping a seizure diary of manually recorded occurrences of seizures in the patient's daily life. This systematic and long-term documentation is essential for therapeutic decision-making and clinical and pharmacological studies.","The primary challenge faced by epilepsy patients during long-term EEG monitoring for seizure detection is the discomfort and impracticality of having electrodes placed on the scalp. Additionally, long-term EEG monitoring can be time-consuming, costly, and may require trained professionals for setup and interpretation.

As an alternative, non-electroencephalogram-based seizure detection devices have several advantages over traditional EEG-based methods. These devices can be more comfortable and user-friendly, as they often come in the form of wearables such as smartwatches, sensors, or even smartphone-based detection methods. They are also less expensive, more accessible, and can provide continuous seizure detection at home, which can improve long-term care and reduce the emotional burden of frequent hospital visits.

In an outpatient context, wearable biosensors are emerging as potential alternatives for continuous EEG recording. These devices provide a balance between signal quality and user acceptability. One subscalp system, the 24/7 EEGTM SubQ, has been CE-marked for epilepsy monitoring and diagnosis, following a trial demonstrating its safety and feasibility. Automatically assisted, visual identification of electrographic seizures has also been demonstrated in the ultra-long-term setting with this system.

Non-invasive wearable biosensors, such as those measuring photoplethysmography (PPG), electromyography (EMG), accelerometry, EEG, electrocardiography (EKG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and skin temperature, are also available. These sensors can track sleep, exercise rates, stress, and other factors that may trigger seizure onset. Currently, there are two FDA and EU-approved wearable sensors for detecting convulsive seizures, and other CE-Marked devices are available, with studies of performance at detecting seizures ongoing.

While most commercially available sensors do not have regulatory approval for use in epilepsy, these non-EEG-based seizure detection devices show promise in providing a more comfortable and accessible method of seizure monitoring for epilepsy patients in an outpatient context.",0.7909631729125977,0.8931034803390503,0.8389358520507812,"['Depending on local practices and individual needs, the patients may be allowed to leave the hospital room for a short duration, removing themselves from the vEEG system. The EEG and video data are monitored around the clock by technicians or clinicians, and the patients have access to an alarm bell that can notify staff of an impending, ongoing, or passed seizure. Nevertheless, epileptic seizures themselves are very infrequent and take up relatively little time of an epilepsy patient’s lifetime. For example, one estimate from an ultra-long-term study puts the time spent having a seizure at only 0.05 % [53, 54]. Long-term monitoring of epilepsy 8 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION and (semi-)automatic detection of epileptic activity with EEG is possible, however, it often requires the patient to wear high-density EEG electrode arrays [55, 56], or have electrodes implanted [57, 58]. An additional practice of monitoring seizures, especially in an outpatient context, is keeping a seizure diary of manually recorded occurrences of seizures in the patient’s daily life. Systematic and long-term documentation of seizures is essential for therapeutic decision-making and clinical and pharmacological studies [59, 60]. As the primary aim of epilepsy treatment is for the patient to become seizure-free, correctly gauging the number of seizure occurrences is paramount to assessing the efficiency of a given treatment. Management and Treatment In modern medicine, there are several options to manage and treat epilepsy. Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) can potentially suppress seizures in two out of three PWEs, but they rarely change the long-term prognosis, which is most affected by epilepsy surgery [14]. In this pro- cess, vEEG monitoring units are essential for effectively treating PWEs. Differential diagnosis and pre-surgical evaluation are the most common reasons to visit an EMU. Patients selected for a surgical intervention based on their diagnosis undergo pre-surgical evaluation. To bet- ter understand their seizures in general and gain knowledge about the localization of seizure onsets to discover potential targets for resection, clinicians provoke seizures in a controlled environment through different means, such as reduction of AEDs, sleep deprivation, or stim- ulation with light pulses [61]. During seizures, the patients are cared for by specialized staff who monitor the seizure manifestation and progression and test for symptoms like muscle tensing or cognitive impairments. This information may help to identify the seizure type and onset localization. Resective epilepsy surgery is only relevant for patients who are AED-refractory, that is, who are not responding to AEDs, and for whom clinicians were able to define a focal seizure onset zone. The aim of the surgery is to potentially reduce or eliminate the recurrence of seizures [62]. During surgery, brain tissue is removed at the location of typical seizure onset while carefully weighing a positive outcome for the patient against minimizing the risk of further neurological damage. On average, between 25 % and 50 % of patients who underwent epilepsy surgery become free of seizures without needing AEDs, but this result can be delayed up to 5 years after surgery [62, 63]. A different method of managing and treating epilepsy and epileptic seizures is neurostim- ulation [64]. Clinicians usually administer this therapy to patients who are AED-refractory and for whom surgery is not an option. Generally, there are three types of neurostimulation frequently employed in epilepsy patients. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is the oldest type of stimulation and uses an extra-cranial methodology to stimulate the vagus nerve on a pre-programmed regular schedule. While VNS can significantly reduce seizure frequency in up to half of the treated population, it has common side effects like hoarseness and speech modulation, especially during stimulation phases [64, 65]. Conversely, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an intracranial stimulation technique that tar- gets a specific brain region to apply regular pulses of electricity, suppressing the propagation or even onset of epileptic seizures. DBS is a promising intervention method for drug-resistant epilepsy patients, but further research and studies must investigate if it significantly improves outcomes [64, 66, 67]. 1.1. FUNDAMENTALS OF EPILEPSY 9 Responsive neurostimulation (RNS) does not stimulate on a set schedule but uses seizure detection methods to decide when to send electrical pulses to the brain [68]. As such, efficient and precise implementations of both detection and stimulation are necessary for RNS therapy to be successful, but the benefit of significantly reduced periods of stimulation compared to other regularly stimulating systems advocates for this neurostimulation method [69]. 10 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 1.2 Fundamentals of Wearable Biosignal Recording « Miniaturization of components has enabled systems that are wearable and nearly invisible, so that individuals can move about and interact freely, supported by their personal information domain. » — Steve Mann, 1997 [70] A wearable device, or wearable, is a self-sufficient electronic device that can be worn on the human body in some form. In this thesis wearables are battery-powered devices which can record at least one sensor modality that represents one of the wearer’s biosignals. While wearable technology in a broader sense has existed for some hundred years, wearable elec- tronic computing devices only emerged in the 1970s and 1980s [71]. Since then, wearables have made giant leaps in the reduction of size and the increase of functionality. While the first systems included backpacks containing sizeable electrical equipment, the invention and rise of mobile phones and smartphones have considerably boosted the development of small, consumer-grade wearables like smartwatches. Nowadays, wearables can record many differ- ent kinds of biosignals from the human body by way of a varied array of different kinds of recording principles and sensors. Signals may, for example, represent brain, muscle, cardiac, electrodermal, or thermal activity, as well as the motion of different body parts (Figure 1.3). Electroencephalography (EEG) captures changes in the brain’s electrical activity by elec- trodes placed on the scalp. Likewise, surface-electromyography (EMG) records muscle activity via electrodes placed above the muscle to capture the electric potentials induced by its activity. A common technique to record cardiac activity is electrocardiography (ECG) which, like EEG and EMG, also requires electrodes to be placed on the skin.']","Depending on local practices and individual needs, the patients may be allowed to leave the hospital room for a short duration, removing themselves from the vEEG system.

Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) can potentially suppress seizures in two out of three PWEs, but they rarely change the long-term prognosis, which is most affected by epilepsy surgery [14]. In this pro- cess, vEEG monitoring units are essential for effectively treating PWEs. Differential diagnosis and pre-surgical evaluation are the most common reasons to visit an EMU. Patients selected for a surgical intervention based on their diagnosis undergo pre-surgical evaluation. To bet- ter understand their seizures in general and gain knowledge about the localization of seizure onsets to discover potential targets for resection, clinicians provoke seizures in a controlled environment through different means, such as reduction of AEDs, sleep deprivation, or stim- ulation with light pulses [61]. During seizures, the patients are cared for by specialized staff who monitor the seizure manifestation and progression and test for symptoms like muscle tensing or cognitive impairments. This information may help to identify the seizure type and onset localization. Resective epilepsy surgery is only relevant for patients who are AED-refractory, that is, who are not responding to AEDs, and for whom clinicians were able to define a focal seizure onset zone. The aim of the surgery is to potentially reduce or eliminate the recurrence of seizures [62]. During surgery, brain tissue is removed at the location of typical seizure onset while carefully weighing a positive outcome for the patient against minimizing the risk of further neurological damage. On average, between 25 % and 50 % of patients who underwent epilepsy surgery become free of seizures without needing AEDs, but this result can be delayed up to 5 years after surgery [62, 63]. A different method of managing and treating epilepsy and epileptic seizures is neurostim- ulation [64]. Clinicians usually administer this therapy to patients who are AED-refractory and for whom surgery is not an option. Generally, there are three types of neurostimulation frequently employed in epilepsy patients. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is the oldest type of stimulation and uses an extra-cranial methodology to stimulate the vagus nerve on a pre-programmed regular schedule. While VNS can significantly reduce seizure frequency in up to half of the treated population, it has common side effects like hoarseness and speech modulation, especially during stimulation phases [64, 65]. Conversely, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an intracranial stimulation technique that tar- gets a specific brain region to apply regular pulses of electricity, suppressing the propagation or even onset of epileptic seizures. DBS is a promising intervention method for drug-resistant epilepsy patients, but further research and studies must investigate if it significantly improves outcomes [64, 66, 67]. 1.1. FUNDAMENTALS OF EPILEPSY 9 Responsive neurostimulation (RNS) does not stimulate on a set schedule but uses seizure detection methods to decide when to send electrical pulses to the brain [68]. As such, efficient and precise implementations of both detection and stimulation are necessary for RNS therapy to be successful, but the benefit of significantly reduced periods of stimulation compared to other regularly stimulating systems advocates for this neurostimulation method [69]. 10 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 1.2 Fundamentals of Wearable Biosignal Recording « Miniaturization of components has enabled systems that are wearable and nearly invisible, so that individuals can move about and interact freely, supported by their personal information domain. » — Steve Mann, 1997 [70] A wearable device, or wearable, is a self-sufficient electronic device that can be worn on the human body in some form. In this thesis wearables are battery-powered devices which can record at least one sensor modality that represents one of the wearer’s biosignals. While wearable technology in a broader sense has existed for some hundred years, wearable elec- tronic computing devices only emerged in the 1970s and 1980s [71]. Since then, wearables have made giant leaps in the reduction of size and the increase of functionality. While the first systems included backpacks containing sizeable electrical equipment, the invention and rise of mobile phones and smartphones have considerably boosted the development of small, consumer-grade wearables like smartwatches. Nowadays, wearables can record many differ- ent kinds of biosignals from the human body by way of a varied array of different kinds of recording principles and sensors. Signals may, for example, represent brain, muscle, cardiac, electrodermal, or thermal activity, as well as the motion of different body parts (Figure 1.3). Electroencephalography (EEG) captures changes in the brain’s electrical activity by elec- trodes placed on the scalp. Likewise, surface-electromyography (EMG) records muscle activity via electrodes placed above the muscle to capture the electric potentials induced by its activity. A common technique to record cardiac activity is electrocardiography (ECG) which, like EEG and EMG, also requires electrodes to be placed on the skin.",0.8002129197120667
